In 1992, the state of New Jersey (NJ) in the United States raised the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. Did such an increase in the minimum wage reduce employment as economic theory predicts? As discussed above, answering this question requires inference about the NJ employment rate in the absence of such a raise in the minimum wage. Since this counterfactual outcome is not observable, we must somehow estimate it using observed data.\nOne possible strategy is to look at another state in which the minimum wage did not increase. For example, the researchers of this study chose the neighboring state, Pennsylvania (PA), on the grounds that NJ’s economy resembles that of Pennsylvania, and hence the fast-food restaurants in the two states are comparable. Under this cross-section comparison design, therefore, the fast-food restaurants in NJ serve as the treatment group receiving the treatment (i.e., the increase in the minimum wage), whereas those in PA represent the control group, which did not receive such a treatment.

Distribition -> ID: {'data_description': 'After the September 11 attacks, the United States and its allies invaded Afghanistan with the goal of dismantling al-Qaeda, which had been operating there under the protection of the Taliban government. In 2003, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) became involved in the conflict, sending in a coalition of international troops organized under the name of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). To wage this war against the Taliban insurgency, the ISAF engaged in a “hearts and minds” campaign, combining economic assistance, service delivery, and protection in order to win the support of civilians. To evaluate the success of such a campaign, it is essential to measure and understand civilians’ experiences and sentiments during the war. However, measuring the experiences and opinions of civilians during wartime is a challenging task because of harsh security conditions, posing potential threats to interviewers and respondents. This means that respondents may inaccurately answer survey questions in order to avoid giving socially undesirable responses.\nA group of social scientists conducted a public opinion survey in southern Afghanistan, the heartland of the insurgency. The survey was administered to a sample of 2754 respondents between January and February 2011. The researchers note that the participation rate was 89%. That is, they originally contacted 3097 males and 343 of them refused to take the survey.

While the probability of selecting each individual in the population is known only approximately, the method in theory should provide a roughly representative sample of the target population.\nWe examine the representativeness of the randomly sampled villages in the Afghanistan data.

Heterogenous treatment effects -> ID: {'data_description': 'Three social scientists conducted an RCT in which they investigated whether social pressure within neighborhoods increases participation. Specifically, during a primary election in the state of Michigan, they randomly assigned registered voters to receive different get-out-the-vote (GOTV) messages and examined whether sending postcards with these messages increased turnout. The researchers exploited the fact that the turnout of individual voters is public information in the United States. The GOTV message of particular interest was designed to induce social pressure by telling voters that after the election their neighbors would be informed about whether they voted in the election or not. The researchers hypothesized that such a namingand-shaming GOTV strategy would increase participation.\nThere are three treatment groups: voters who receive either the social pressure message, the civic duty message, or the Hawthorne effect message. The Hawthorne effect refers to the phenomenon where study subjects behave differently because they know they are being observed by researchers. The experiment also has a control group which consists of those voters receiving no message. The researchers randomly assigned each voter to one of the four groups and examined whether the voter turnout was different across the groups.\n\nThe data is in the file social.csv.\nVariable Description\nhhsize: household size of the voter\nmessages: GOTV messages the voter received (Civic Duty, Control, Neighbors, Hawthorne)\nsex: sex of the voter (female or male)\nyearofbirth: year of birth of the voter\nprimary2004: whether the voter voted in the 2004 primary election (1=voted, 0=abstained)\nprimary2006: whether the voter turned out in the 2006 primary election (1=voted, 0=abstained)', 'question': 'What is the difference in the average causal effect of the Neighbors message on whether the voter voted in the 2006 primary election between those who voted in the 2004 primary election and those who did not?

To wage this war against the Taliban insurgency, the ISAF engaged in a “hearts and minds” campaign, combining economic assistance, service delivery, and protection in order to win the support of civilians. To evaluate the success of such a campaign, it is essential to measure and understand civilians’ experiences and sentiments during the war. However, measuring the experiences and opinions of civilians during wartime is a challenging task because of harsh security conditions, posing potential threats to interviewers and respondents. This means that respondents may inaccurately answer survey questions in order to avoid giving socially undesirable responses.\nA group of social scientists conducted a public opinion survey in southern Afghanistan, the heartland of the insurgency.

They varied only the names of job applicants, while leaving the other information in the résumés unchanged.\nFor some candidates, stereotypically African-American-sounding names such as Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones were used, whereas other résumés contained\nstereotypically white-sounding names, such as Emily Walsh or Greg Baker. The researchers then compared the callback rates between these two groups and examined\nwhether applicants with stereotypically black names received fewer callbacks than those with stereotypically white names. The positions to which the applications were\nsent were either in sales, administrative support, clerical, or customer services.\n\nData is in the CSV data file resume.csv.\nVariable Description\nfirstname: first name of the fictitious job applicant\nsex: sex of applicant (female or male)\nrace: race of applicant (black or white)\ncall: whether a callback was made (1= yes, 0= no)', 'question': 'What is the racial gap in callback rate among white and black female applicants?
