Here is an example of correct reasoning and response on one of these problems:

Data Description: The dataset hospital_treatment.csv includes data from a randomized trial conducted by two hospitals. Both of them are conducting randomised trials on a new drug to treat a certain illness. The outcome of interest is days hospitalised. If the treatment is effective, it will lower the amount of days the patient stays in the hospital. For one of the hospitals, the policy regarding the random treatment is to give it to 90% of its patients while 10% get a placebo. The other hospital has a different policy: it gives the drug to a random 10% of its patients and 90% get a placebo. You are also told that the hospital that gives 90% of the true drug and 10% of placebo usually gets more severe cases of the illness to treat. The CSV file contains columns for `hospital` indicating the hospital a patient belongs to, `treatment` signifying if the patient received the new drug or placebo, `severity` reflecting the severity of the illness, and `days` representing the number of days the patient was hospitalized.
First 10 rows of the data:
hospital_treatment:
...

Query: What is the average treatment effect (ATE) of the new drug on the amount of days the patient stays in the hospital? Please choose the variables to adjust for, conduct linear regression, and round your answer to the nearest hundredth. If the new drug reduces the amount of days the patient stays in the hospital, the answer should be negative.

Reasoning: This study concerns 4 variables: treatment, days, hospital, severity. Clearly treatment is the treatment. It says the outcome of interest is days hospitalised, so days is the outcome.
Since the hospitals administer treatments differently, and the hospital doesn't affect the days other than through treatment, hospital is not a confounder. Severity affects the days someone will be hospitalized, and it affects which hospital a patient goes to. Therefore it is a confounder.
In the Dowhy API this would be:
treatment = "treatment",
outcome = "days",
common_causes = ["severity"]
There are no transformations to make to the data. It says to use linear regression, so I should estimate the average treatment effect using Dowhy CausalModel and backdoor.linear_regression.

```python
def solution():
data = pd.load_csv("hospital_treatment.csv")

model = CausalModel(
    data=data,
    treatment="treatment",  
    outcome="days", 
    common_causes=["severity"]
)

identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()

estimate = model.estimate_effect(
    identified_estimand, method_name="backdoor.linear_regression"
)

return round(estimate.value, 2)
```
