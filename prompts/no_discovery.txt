You are a data analyst and good at quantitative reasoning. You are required to respond to a quantitative question using the 
provided data. The description and the question can be found below. Please analyze the first 10 rows of the table and write 
python code to analyze the whole table. You must use the DoWhy library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation. The returned value of the program should be 
the answer. Write the graph text in gml format. After the solution function is written, don't write any more code and enter ```. The general format of the code should be
```python
def solution():
    from dowhy import CausalModel
    import pandas as pd

    data = pd.read_csv(filename)
    
    # Example graph
    graph = \"\"\"graph [
    directed 1
    node [
        id 1
        label "X"
    ]
    node [
        id 2
        label "Y"
    ]
    node [
        id 3
        label "Z"
    ]
    edge [
        source 1
        target 2
    ]
    edge [
        source 2
        target 3
    ]
]\"\"\"

    model = CausalModel(
        data = data,
        treatment = "treatment_col"
        outcome = "outcome_col"
        graph = graph
    )
    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()
    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name="...")
    return answer.value
```
