Some customers who were assigned to receive the push are not receiving it, because they probably have an older phone that doesn\u2019t support the kind of push the marketing team designed.\nThe dataset app_engagement_push.csv contains records for 10,000 random customers. Each record includes whether an in-app purchase was made (in_app_purchase), if a marketing push was assigned to the user (push_assigned), and if the marketing push was successfully delivered (push_delivered).\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\napp_engagement_push:\nin_app_purchase  push_assigned  push_delivered\n6252               64              1               1\n4684              116              0               0\n1731               58              1               1\n4742               40              1               1\n4521               84              0               0\n6340               62              1               1\n576                40              0               0\n5202               75              0               0\n6363               81              0               0\n439                72              0               0\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of receiving the marketing push on in-app purchases, as estimated using linear regression and instrumental variable, rounded to two decimal places?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) using linear regression and instrumental variable methods. Let's start by understanding the data and the question.\n\nThe dataset is called app_engagement_push.csv. The first 10 rows show columns in_app_purchase, push_assigned, and push_delivered. The question is about the effect of receiving the marketing push on in-app purchases. \n\nSo, the treatment here is whether the user received the push. But wait, push_assigned is whether they were assigned, and push_delivered is whether it was actually delivered. So, the actual treatment is push_delivered, right? Because even if someone was assigned, if the push wasn't delivered, they didn't receive it. So the treatment variable is push_delivered. The outcome is in_app_purchase. \n\nBut how do I model this? Since push_delivered is the actual treatment, but push_assigned might be an instrument. Because the marketing team assigned pushes, but delivery could be affected by other factors (like phone compatibility). So push_assigned could be an instrument for push_delivered. \n\nWait, the question says to use linear regression and instrumental variable. So maybe the IV method is instrumental variable regression. \n\nBut first, I need to structure the causal model. According to the DoWhy library, I need to identify treatment, outcome, common causes, instruments, etc. \n\nThe treatment is push_delivered. The outcome is in_app_purchase. \n\nCommon causes would be variables that affect both treatment and outcome. The push_assigned might be a common cause? Or maybe not. Wait, push_assigned is the assignment, which might be random. But in reality, push_assigned could be an instrument. Because the push is assigned to users, but not all get delivered. So the instrument is push_assigned, which affects push_delivered, and push_delivered affects in_app_purchase. \n\nSo, the model would have treatment as push_delivered, outcome as in_app_purchase, instrument as push_assigned. Common causes would be any variables that affect both treatment and outcome. But looking at the data, the first 10 rows have in_app_purchase, push_assigned, push_delivered. Are there other variables? The description says the dataset has these three variables. So perhaps there are no other variables. Wait, but the problem says the dataset has 10,000 records with those three variables. So the only variables are in_app_purchase, push_assigned, push_delivered. \n\nSo, the common causes would be none? Or maybe push_assigned is a common cause? No, because push_assigned is the instrument. Wait, the common causes are variables that affect both treatment and outcome. So, if push_assigned is the instrument, then the treatment is push_delivered. So, the instrument (push_assigned) affects the treatment (push_delivered), and the treatment affects the outcome (in_app_purchase). But common causes are variables that affect both treatment and outcome. If there are no other variables, maybe there are none. But that's possible. \n\nBut in the data, perhaps push_assigned is the instrument, and the common causes are nothing. So, the causal model would have treatment as push_delivered, outcome as in_app_purchase, instrument as push_assigned. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify treatment: push_delivered\n2. Outcome: in_app_purchase\n3. Instruments: push_assigned\n4. Common causes: maybe none? Or maybe the variables that are confounders. Wait, if there are no other variables, then common causes could be none. But in reality, maybe there are other variables, but the data only has these three. \n\nWait, the problem says that the dataset has these three variables. So, the variables are:\n\n- in_app_purchase (outcome)\n- push_assigned (instrument)\n- push_delivered (treatment)\n\nSo, the model would be: push_assigned (instrument) affects push_delivered (treatment), which affects in_app_purchase (outcome). \n\nSo, the common causes would be any variables that affect both treatment and outcome. But in this case, if there are no other variables, then perhaps there are none. However, in reality, maybe some variables are not present. \n\nBut according to the problem's data, the variables are only these three. So, the causal model would have treatment as push_delivered, outcome as in_app_purchase, instrument as push_assigned, and common causes as none. \n\nWait, but the common causes are variables that affect both treatment and outcome. For example, if there's a variable that affects both push_delivered and in_app_purchase, then it's a common cause. However, in this case, since the data only has these three variables, and assuming that push_delivered is the treatment, and push_assigned is the instrument, then there are no other variables. \n\nSo, the DoWhy model would be constructed with treatment = 'push_delivered', outcome = 'in_app_purchase', instruments = ['push_assigned'], and common_causes = [] (if there are none). \n\nBut wait, maybe there are common causes. For example, if the users who were assigned the push (push_assigned) have different characteristics that affect both push_delivered and in_app_purchase. However, since the data does not include such variables, we can't account for them. \n\nIn that case, the model would be constructed with the instrument as push_assigned, treatment as push_delivered, outcome as in_app_purchase, and common causes as none. \n\nNow, the next step is to use DoWhy to build the model. \n\nOnce the model is built, the identify_effect method would find the estimand. Since we are using an instrumental variable approach, the effect is estimated using the IV method. \n\nThe question asks for the LATE, which is the average treatment effect for the compliers (those who received the treatment when assigned). \n\nSo, the method_name would be 'iv.instrumental_variable' or 'iv.two_stage_regression'? Wait, the DoWhy documentation says that the method names are like 'iv.instrumental_variable' or 'iv.two_stage_regression'. \n\nBut the user wants to use linear regression and instrumental variable. So perhaps using the instrumental variable method with linear regression. \n\nSo the method_name could be 'iv.instrumental_variable' or 'iv.two_stage_regression'. \n\nBut the problem says to use linear regression and instrumental variable. So, the IV estimator would be instrumental variable, which could be done with the 'iv.instrumental_variable' method. \n\nBut I need to check the DoWhy method names. For example, the 'iv.instrumental_variable' method would use linear regression. \n\nSo, in the code, after creating the model, the steps would be:\n\n- Identify the effect using the model.identify_effect()\n- Then estimate the effect using model.estimate_effect with method_name='iv.instrumental_variable'\n\nWait, but the user wants to use linear regression and instrumental variable. So, the IV method would be the instrumental variable estimator, which is a two-stage regression. \n\nBut the DoWhy library's estimate_effect method requires specifying the method name. For example, for IV, the method name would be 'iv.instrumental_variable' or 'iv.two_stage_regression'. \n\nBut let me check the documentation. The documentation says that for IV methods, the method names can be 'iv.instrumental_variable' or 'iv.two_stage_regression'. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nmodel = CausalModel(\n    data = data,\n    treatment = \"push_delivered\",\n    outcome = \"in_app_purchase\",\n    instruments = [\"push_assigned\"],\n    common_causes = []\n)\n\nThen, identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\nThen, answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name='iv.instrumental_variable')\n\nBut wait, the problem says to use linear regression and instrumental variable. So, the instrumental variable method would use linear regression. \n\nAlternatively, the 'iv.instrumental_variable' method might use linear regression by default. \n\nSo, the code would use that method. \n\nBut let me make sure. The example in the documentation for the estimate_effect method includes methods like 'iv.instrumental_variable'. \n\nSo, the code would be written as such. \n\nNow, the first step is to read the data. The data is in app_engagement_push.csv. So, in the solution function, the code would read the CSV file. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('app_engagement_push.csv')\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"push_delivered\",\n        outcome = \"in_app_purchase\",\n        instruments = [\"push_assigned\"],\n        common_causes = []\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name='iv.instrumental_variable')\n    return answer.value\n\nBut wait, the question says to use linear regression and instrumental variable. So, the method might be 'iv.instrumental_variable' which is a linear IV estimator. \n\nAlternatively, the 'iv.two_stage_regression' method could also be used. \n\nBut according to the documentation, the method names for IV include 'iv.instrumental_variable' and 'iv.two_stage_regression'. \n\nSo, the code could use 'iv.instrumental_variable' or 'iv.two_stage_regression'. \n\nBut the user wants to use linear regression. So, the instrumental variable estimator would use linear regression in both stages. \n\nSo, the code would use 'iv.instrumental_variable' as the method name. \n\nBut let me check the documentation again. The example for the estimate_effect method includes 'iv.instrumental_variable' as a possible method name. \n\nTherefore, the code above should work. \n\nBut wait, the treatment is push_delivered. The instrument is push_assigned. So, the model would use push_assigned as the instrument for push_delivered, which affects in_app_purchase. \n\nBut the data might have some issues. For example, the push_delivered is the actual treatment. So, in the model, the treatment is push_delivered, and the instrument is push_assigned. \n\nBut what about common causes? The problem says that the data has no other variables, so common_causes is empty. \n\nBut perhaps, if there are other variables, but the data is not provided, we have to assume that there are none. \n\nSo, the code is as above. \n\nNow, after running this code, the answer.value would give the LATE estimate. \n\nBut the problem says to round to two decimal places. \n\nSo, the code would return the answer.value rounded to two decimals. \n\nWait, the question says to return the answer as the value, but the code returns answer.value. \n\nSo, the code would have:\n\nreturn round(answer.value, 2)\n\nBut the solution function must return the answer.value. Wait, no. The user says that the returned value of the program should be the answer. So, the code should return answer.value, but rounded to two decimal places. \n\nBut the problem says to round to two decimal places. So, the code should return the rounded value. \n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nreturn round(answer.value, 2)\n\nBut the code as written would return answer.value. So, in the code, after getting the answer, we need to round it. \n\nBut the DoWhy library's estimate_effect returns a CausalEstimate object, and answer.value is the estimate. \n\nSo, in the solution function, after getting answer, we can round it. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nreturn round(answer.value, 2)\n\nTherefore, the code should include that. \n\nBut wait, the code must be written as per the user's instruction, which says that the solution() function must be defined, and the code must be in the format given. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('app_engagement_push.csv')\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"push_delivered\",\n        outcome = \"in_app_purchase\",\n        instruments = [\"push_assigned\"],\n        common_causes = []\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name='iv.instrumental_variable')\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the first 10 rows of the data have push_delivered as 1 or 0. So, the treatment is binary. The outcome is in_app_purchase, which is a numeric variable (since the first row has 64, which could be the amount spent or number of purchases). \n\nBut the model will handle this as a continuous outcome. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the IV method requires that the instrument is exogenous. But since the problem states that the marketing team assigned the push, it's possible that push_assigned is a valid instrument. \n\nBut the code is written as per the problem's instructions. \n\nAnother thing: the DoWhy library may require that the treatment and outcome are specified correctly. \n\nSo, the code should be correct. \n\nBut what if the common causes are not empty? For example, if there are other variables that affect both treatment and outcome. However, since the data only has three variables, and the treatment is push_delivered, the outcome is in_app_purchase, and the instrument is push_assigned, the common_causes would be empty. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('app_engagement_push.csv')\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"push_delivered\",\n        outcome = \"in_app_purchase\",\n        instruments = [\"push_assigned\"],\n        common_causes = []\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name='iv.instrumental_variable')\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n```"}

We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Regression\nUse linear regression.\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nMethod 3: Propensity Score Stratification\nWe will be using propensity scores to stratify units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_strat = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_stratification\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\")\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\nAlternatively, Causalinference has a simple way to train bias adjusted matching estimators:\nfrom causalinference import CausalModel\n\ncm = CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"recovery\"].values, \n    D=med[\"medication\"].values, \n    X=med[[\"severity\", \"age\", \"sex\"]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nprint(cm.estimates)\n\nMethod 5: Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\nData Description:\nA study is conducted to measure the effect of a marketing push on user engagement, specifically in-app purchases.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of receiving the marketing push on in-app purchases, using linear regression and instrumental variable methods. The dataset is app_engagement_push.csv, and we need to use the DoWhy library to build a causal model and estimate the effect.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the data. From the first 10 rows provided, the columns are in_app_purchase, push_assigned, and push_delivered. The treatment here is whether the marketing push was assigned (push_assigned), but not all assigned pushes are delivered (push_delivered). The outcome is in_app_purchase. \n\nWait, but the question mentions using instrumental variable. In instrumental variable methods, the instrument is a variable that affects the treatment but not the outcome directly. In this case, the push_delivered might be the instrument. Because the push_assigned is the treatment (whether the user was assigned to receive the push), but push_delivered is whether the push was actually delivered. So, the delivery is the instrument, since it affects whether the user receives the push (treatment) but shouldn't directly affect in-app purchases except through the push. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that some users assigned to receive the push aren't getting it because of older phones. So push_delivered is the actual treatment, and push_assigned is the assignment. So maybe the instrument is push_assigned, but that's not clear. Wait, the question is about the effect of receiving the marketing push on in-app purchases. So the actual treatment is push_delivered. However, the push_delivered might be determined by the push_assigned and other factors. But since the push_delivered is the actual treatment, maybe push_assigned is the instrument. Or perhaps the instrument is push_delivered? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn the setup, push_assigned is the assignment to receive the push, and push_delivered is whether the push was actually delivered. So push_delivered is the actual treatment (whether the user received the push). But the push_assigned is the instrument? Or is the push_delivered the instrument? Wait, the question is about the effect of receiving the marketing push. So the treatment is push_delivered. But the push_delivered might be influenced by push_assigned and other factors. However, in this scenario, the push_delivered might be the actual treatment. But the assignment (push_assigned) could be the instrument. Wait, but if the push_delivered is the actual treatment, then the instrument would be something else. But the problem says that the push_assigned is the treatment, but some are not delivered. So the actual treatment is push_delivered. However, the push_delivered is determined by push_assigned (maybe) and other factors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the push_assigned is the instrument. Because the push_delivered is the actual treatment, but the push_assigned is the variable that determines who gets the push delivered. Wait, but the push_delivered might be the actual treatment. For example, if the push_assigned is the assignment, but some users are not delivered (push_delivered=0). So the actual treatment is push_delivered. But the push_assigned is the variable that determines the treatment. So in that case, push_assigned could be the instrument, but that seems odd. Wait, no. The instrument should be a variable that affects the treatment but not the outcome. So if the push_delivered is the treatment, then the instrument could be push_assigned. Because the assignment is a variable that affects whether the push is delivered (treatment), but push_assigned shouldn't directly affect in-app purchases except through the push. \n\nBut in this case, the push_delivered is the treatment (whether the user received the push), and push_assigned is the instrument. Wait, but the push_assigned is the assignment, which is the reason for the treatment. So perhaps the correct setup is that the treatment is push_delivered (the actual delivery), and the instrument is push_assigned (the assignment). However, in the question, the treatment is the marketing push, so the push_delivered is the treatment. The push_assigned is the instrument, because it's the variable that determines who gets the push delivered. But in that case, the instrument is push_assigned, and the treatment is push_delivered. \n\nBut this might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the treatment is push_delivered, and the instrument is push_assigned. But in reality, the push_delivered is the treatment. However, the push_assigned might be the instrument. \n\nAlternatively, the problem may consider push_delivered as the treatment, and push_assigned as the instrument. Because the push_delivered is determined by push_assigned and other factors, but the assignment (push_assigned) is the instrument. However, the question is about the effect of receiving the marketing push (push_delivered) on in-app purchases. \n\nSo, the correct setup would be:\n\nTreatment: push_delivered (whether the marketing push was delivered)\nInstrument: push_assigned (the assignment to receive the push)\nOutcome: in_app_purchase\n\nBut then, the instrument (push_assigned) affects the treatment (push_delivered), but not the outcome directly. \n\nHowever, the problem may be structured differently. Let me re-read the data description. \n\nThe data description says: A study is conducted to measure the effect of a marketing push on user engagement, specifically in-app purchases. Some customers who were assigned to receive the push are not receiving it, because they probably have an older phone that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support the kind of push the marketing team designed. The dataset includes push_assigned (whether the user was assigned to receive the push) and push_delivered (whether the push was delivered). \n\nSo the actual treatment is push_delivered. The assignment is push_assigned, which is the variable that determines who gets the push, but not all assigned users get the push delivered. Therefore, the treatment is push_delivered, and the instrument is push_assigned. \n\nBut then, the question asks for the LATE, which is the effect of the treatment (push_delivered) on the outcome (in_app_purchase), using instrumental variable. So the instrumental variable method would use push_assigned as the instrument. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify treatment and effect. The treatment is push_delivered (whether the push was delivered), and the outcome is in_app_purchase.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the effect of receiving the marketing push on in-app purchases\". So the treatment is receiving the push (push_delivered), and the outcome is in_app_purchase. So the treatment is push_delivered. \n\nBut the problem is that push_delivered is the actual treatment, but the push_assigned is the variable that affects the treatment. So the instrument is push_assigned. \n\nTherefore, the model should be set up with treatment as push_delivered, outcome as in_app_purchase, and instrument as push_assigned. \n\nBut the question says to use both linear regression and instrumental variable methods. Wait, the question is asking for the LATE using linear regression and instrumental variable methods. Wait, no. The question is phrased as \"estimated using linear regression and instrumental variable\". Wait, maybe the user wants to use two different methods: one is linear regression (which might be part of the instrumental variable method), but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the question says: \"What is the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of receiving the marketing push on in-app purchases, as estimated using linear regression and instrumental variable, rounded to two decimal places?\" \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is asking to use both methods. But LATE is typically estimated using instrumental variable methods, like the two-stage least squares (2SLS), which is a type of instrumental variable. However, the mention of linear regression might be referring to the first stage (regression of treatment on instrument) and the second stage (regression of outcome on treatment). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking to use the instrumental variable method (like the Wald estimator) and also use a regression approach. \n\nBut the main point is to use DoWhy to build a causal model and estimate the effect. \n\nSo, first, I need to identify treatment, outcome, and instruments. \n\nThe treatment is the actual delivery of the push (push_delivered). The outcome is in_app_purchase. The instrument is push_assigned, which affects the treatment (push_delivered). \n\nBut wait, maybe the treatment is push_assigned, and the push_delivered is a mediator. But no, the question is about the effect of receiving the push, which is push_delivered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the treatment is push_assigned, and the push_delivered is a confounder. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, the problem states that the push_assigned is the assignment, and some of those assigned are not delivered. So, the actual treatment is whether the push was delivered. The assignment (push_assigned) is the variable that determines who gets the push delivered. Therefore, the instrument is push_assigned, and the treatment is push_delivered. \n\nTherefore, the model should be built with treatment as push_delivered, outcome as in_app_purchase, and instrument as push_assigned. \n\nNow, the next step is to use DoWhy to build the model. \n\nBut according to the DoWhy documentation, the CausalModel requires treatment, outcome, and optionally common causes or instruments. Since we have an instrument (push_assigned), we need to include that. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify treatment and effect: treatment is push_delivered, outcome is in_app_purchase.\n\n2. Identify method: since we are using instrumental variable, the method would be \"iv.instrumental_variable\".\n\n3. Variables to adjust for: in the case of instrumental variables, the common causes (confounders) are the variables that affect both the treatment and outcome. However, in this scenario, we don't have information about other confounders. So, if there are no other variables, we can proceed. \n\nBut the data has three variables: in_app_purchase (outcome), push_assigned (instrument), and push_delivered (treatment). \n\nAssuming that the only confounder is push_delivered and push_assigned? Wait, no. The variables are in_app_purchase, push_assigned, and push_delivered. Are there any other variables that might be confounders? The data has only these three columns, so no other variables. So, the model would have treatment as push_delivered, outcome as in_app_purchase, instrument as push_assigned, and no common causes (since there are no other variables). \n\nBut maybe the treatment (push_delivered) and outcome (in_app_purchase) are not directly confounded by other variables, except for the instrument (push_assigned). \n\nWait, but the instrument (push_assigned) affects the treatment (push_delivered), and the outcome (in_app_purchase) may be affected by the treatment (push_delivered). So, the model is set up as:\n\n- Instrument: push_assigned\n\n- Treatment: push_delivered\n\n- Outcome: in_app_purchase\n\nSo, using instrumental variables, we can estimate the LATE. \n\nBut for the DoWhy CausalModel, the parameters are treatment, outcome, common_causes, instruments. Since we have an instrument (push_assigned), we need to include that in the instruments parameter. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nmodel = CausalModel(\n    data = data,\n    treatment = \"push_delivered\",\n    outcome = \"in_app_purchase\",\n    instruments = [\"push_assigned\"]\n)\n\nThen, identify the effect, and use the iv.instrumental_variable method. \n\nBut the question also mentions using linear regression. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to using the linear regression approach for the instrumental variable method. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to use two different methods, but the problem says \"as estimated using linear regression and instrumental variable\", but that's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the effect using both methods (like, using instrumental variable and using regression) and compare them. But the problem states to return the answer, so perhaps it's a mistake and the actual intended method is instrumental variable, given that LATE is typically estimated via IV. \n\nBut given the problem's wording, it's possible that the user expects both methods. However, the DoWhy library's estimate_effect method allows using the iv.instrumental_variable method. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Use the CausalModel with treatment as push_delivered, outcome as in_app_purchase, and instruments as push_assigned.\n\n- Identify the effect using the iv method.\n\n- Estimate the effect with the iv.instrumental_variable method. \n\nWait, but the DoWhy documentation says that for instrumental variable, the method_name is \"iv.instrumental_variable\", and the parameters include the instrument name. \n\nWait, looking back, the model's __init__ includes instruments as a parameter. So, in the code, the instruments are provided. Then, when estimating, the method is iv.instrumental_variable. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nmodel = CausalModel(\n    data = data,\n    treatment = \"push_delivered\",\n    outcome = \"in_app_purchase\",\n    instruments = [\"push_assigned\"]\n)\n\nidentified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\nanswer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\")\n\nThen, the answer.value would be the LATE. \n\nBut let's think again about the data. Are there any other variables that might be confounders? Since the dataset only has three variables, the only possible confounder would be push_delivered and push_assigned. But in the model, the instrument is push_assigned, and the treatment is push_delivered. So, the model assumes that the only confounder is the instrument, but that's not necessarily the case. However, since there are no other variables, the code would proceed with the given setup. \n\nWait, but in the DoWhy model, when using instruments, the common_causes parameter is required if there are confounders. However, in this case, if there are no other confounders, then common_causes can be omitted, and the model will assume that the only variable affecting both treatment and outcome is the instrument. \n\nWait, no. The model's identify_effect method would check the causal graph. Since we provided the instrument, the model would assume that the instrument is the only one affecting the treatment, and the treatment affects the outcome. \n\nBut the problem is that the treatment and outcome might be correlated through other variables not present in the data. However, since the data only has three variables, the model can't account for other confounders. \n\nSo, proceeding with the model as described. \n\nBut let's check the first 10 rows again. For example, in the first row, push_delivered is 1, and in_app_purchase is 64. So, the model would take these into account. \n\nAnother thing to note: the treatment (push_delivered) is binary (0 or 1), and the outcome (in_app_purchase) is the number of purchases. Wait, the first row shows in_app_purchase as 64, which might be the number of purchases per user. But the problem says that the data includes \"whether an in-app purchase was made (in_app_purchase)\". Wait, the column name is in_app_purchase, but the values are numbers like 64, 116, 58, etc. That suggests that in_app_purchase is the amount spent, not a binary variable. So, the outcome is a continuous variable (amount of purchase), and the treatment is whether the push was delivered (binary). \n\nTherefore, using linear regression in the instrumental variable method would make sense. \n\nSo, the code would be as follows. \n\nBut first, the data is read from the CSV file. The code would read the CSV, then create the CausalModel with treatment as push_delivered, outcome as in_app_purchase, and instruments as push_assigned. Then, identify the effect and estimate using the iv.instrumental_variable method. \n\nBut the answer should be the LATE value. \n\nNow, let's think about the possible issues. For example, if the instrument (push_assigned) is not exogenous, or if there are other confounders, but given the data, we have to proceed. \n\nAnother possible approach is to use the \"iv.instrumental_variable\" method, which would estimate the effect using the Wald estimator. \n\nAlternatively, the code might need to use the method \"iv.instrumental_variable\" with some parameters. \n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(\"app_engagement_push.csv\")\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"push_delivered\",\n        outcome = \"in_app_purchase\",\n        instruments = [\"push_assigned\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\")\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n\nBut wait, in the data, the treatment (push_delivered) is binary, and the outcome is a continuous variable. The instrumental variable method would use the Wald estimator, which is the ratio of the coefficient of the treatment in the outcome regression (second stage) to the coefficient of the instrument in the treatment regression (first stage). \n\nBut with DoWhy, the method \"iv.instrumental_variable\" would handle this. \n\nAnother thing to check: are there any confounders? Since the data has only three variables, but the treatment (push_delivered) and outcome (in_app_purchase) might have other confounders not in the data. However, the question doesn't mention any, so we proceed. \n\nTherefore, the code as written should work. \n\nBut let's test the example. For instance, using the first 10 rows, but since the data is 10,000 rows, the code would process the entire data. \n\nBut the problem says that the user may have to adjust for variables. However, since there are no other variables, the code doesn't need to adjust for anything else. \n\nTherefore, the final code should be as above, and the answer would be the LATE value rounded to two decimal places.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(\"app_engagement_push.csv\")\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"push_delivered\",\n        outcome = \"in_app_purchase\",\n        instruments = [\"push_assigned\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\")\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n```"}
