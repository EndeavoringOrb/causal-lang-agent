We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Regression\nUse linear regression.\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nMethod 3: Propensity Score Stratification\nWe will be using propensity scores to stratify units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_strat = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_stratification\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\")\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\nAlternatively, Causalinference has a simple way to train bias adjusted matching estimators:\nfrom causalinference import CausalModel\n\ncm = CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"recovery\"].values, \n    D=med[\"medication\"].values, \n    X=med[[\"severity\", \"age\", \"sex\"]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nprint(cm.estimates)\n\nMethod 5: Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\nData Description:\nThe National Study of Learning Mindsets is a randomised study conducted in U.S. public high schools which aims at finding the impact of a growth mindset. The way it works is that students receive from the school a seminar to instill in them a growth mindset. Then, they follow up the students in their college years to measure how well they\u2019ve performed academically. This measurement was compiled into an achievement score and standardized. The CSV file learning_mindset.csv contains simulated data of this research.\nVariable Description\nintervention: the intervention of the growth mindset;\nachievement_score: the standardized academic achievement score;\nschoolid: identifier of the student\u2019s school;\nsuccess_expect: self-reported expectations for success in the future, a proxy for prior achievement, measured prior to random assignment;\nethnicity: categorical variable for student race/ethnicity;\ngender: categorical variable for student identified gender;\nfrst_in_family: categorical variable for student first-generation status, i.e. first in family to go to college;\nschool_urbanicity: school-level categorical variable for urbanicity of the school, i.e. rural, suburban, etc;\nschool_mindset: school-level mean of students\u2019 fixed mindsets, reported prior to random assignment, standardized;\nschool_achievement: school achievement level, as measured by test scores and college preparation for the previous 4 cohorts of students, standardized;\nschool_ethnic_minority: school racial/ethnic minority composition, i.e., percentage of student body that is Black, Latino, or Native American, standardized;\nschool_poverty: school poverty concentration, i.e., percentage of students who are from families whose incomes fall below the federal poverty line, standardized;\nschool_size: total number of students in all four grade levels in the school, standardized.\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nlearning_mindset:\nschoolid  intervention  ...  school_poverty  school_size\n3625        75             0  ...        0.230755    -1.511909\n3037         5             1  ...       -1.735164    -0.792146\n2574        17             1  ...        1.043998    -0.470404\n1488        47             1  ...        1.267680     0.958510\n3677        74             0  ...       -0.657131    -0.323959\n8860        17             0  ...        1.043998    -0.470404\n7883        26             0  ...       -0.259910    -0.056286\n1692        42             1  ...        0.504999    -1.214960\n39          76             1  ...        0.224077    -0.426757\n3441        76             0  ...        0.224077    -0.426757\n\n[10 rows x 13 columns]\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average treatment effect of the growth mindset on the achievement score? Please use propensity score weighting in estimation, use logistic regression to estimate the propensity score, and round the final answer to the nearest hundredth."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the average treatment effect (ATE) of the growth mindset intervention on the achievement score using propensity score weighting with logistic regression for the propensity scores. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the data. The dataset includes variables like intervention (treatment), achievement_score (outcome), and several covariates such as success_expect, ethnicity, gender, etc. The treatment is whether the student received the growth mindset seminar (intervention = 1) or not (0). \n\nSince the question specifies using propensity score weighting, I remember that propensity scores are the probability of receiving the treatment given the covariates. The steps would involve estimating these scores using logistic regression, then using inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding.\n\nBut wait, in DoWhy, there's a method for propensity score weighting. Let me check the parameters. The method_name would be \"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\", and the method_params should specify the weighting scheme. The default is \"ips_weight\", but I need to make sure that logistic regression is used for estimating the propensity scores. Oh, right, DoWhy uses logistic regression by default for binary treatments when estimating propensity scores. So I don't need to do anything extra there.\n\nNow, what variables should be included as common causes (confounders)? The treatment (intervention) could be correlated with the outcome (achievement_score) through variables like success_expect, ethnicity, gender, frst_in_family, and school-level variables. All these covariates that are related to both treatment assignment and the outcome should be included in common_causes. \n\nLooking at the variable list, the individual-level variables are success_expect, ethnicity, gender, frst_in_family. The school-level variables like school_urbanicity, school_mindset, school_achievement, school_ethnic_minority, school_poverty, school_size. Since schoolid is an identifier, but school-level variables are already included, maybe schoolid isn't needed unless there's clustering. But since we're using propensity score weighting, perhaps including all relevant school-level variables as common causes is sufficient.\n\nSo the common_causes list would be all those variables except the treatment and outcome. Let me list them:\n\n[\"success_expect\", \"ethnicity\", \"gender\", \"frst_in_family\", \"school_urbanicity\", \"school_mindset\", \"school_achievement\", \"school_ethnic_minority\", \"school_poverty\", \"school_size\"]\n\nWait, the variables are:\n\nLooking back, the variables in the data (from the first 10 rows) are schoolid, intervention, achievement_score, success_expect, ethnicity, gender, frst_in_family, school_urbanicity, school_mindset, school_achievement, school_ethnic_minority, school_poverty, school_size. So excluding the treatment (intervention) and outcome (achievement_score), the rest are covariates. But schoolid is an identifier. Should I include it? Probably not, unless there's clustering within schools. However, since school-level variables are already included (like school_achievement, etc.), maybe schoolid is redundant. However, if the treatment was assigned at the school level, then schoolid would matter. But in the data, intervention is per student, so schoolid might not be necessary as a covariate unless there's unmeasured school-level confounding. But since we have school-level variables already, perhaps it's okay to exclude schoolid.\n\nSo the common_causes should be all the other variables except intervention, achievement_score, and schoolid. So that's success_expect, ethnicity, gender, frst_in_family, school_urbanicity, school_mindset, school_achievement, school_ethnic_minority, school_poverty, school_size. \n\nNow, setting up the CausalModel in DoWhy. The treatment is \"intervention\", outcome is \"achievement_score\", common_causes as the list above. Then, identify the effect, and estimate using propensity score weighting with the specified method. \n\nThe code would look like:\n\nmodel = CausalModel(\n    data=data,\n    treatment='intervention',\n    outcome='achievement_score',\n    common_causes=['success_expect', 'ethnicity', 'gender', 'frst_in_family', 'school_urbanicity', 'school_mindset', 'school_achievement', 'school_ethnic_minority', 'school_poverty', 'school_size']\n)\n\nThen identify the effect, and estimate with method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\", and method_params={\"weighting_scheme\": \"ips_weight\"} (though maybe that's default). Also, since the user specified logistic regression for propensity scores, DoWhy uses that by default for binary treatments, so no need to adjust that.\n\nOnce the effect is estimated, round the value to the nearest hundredth (two decimal places).\n\nWait, but DoWhy's estimate_effect returns the ATE by default? The target_units parameter can be set to \"ate\" (average treatment effect). The code example for weighting shows target_units=\"ate\", so that's correct.\n\nNow, possible issues: categorical variables. For example, ethnicity, gender, frst_in_family, school_urbanicity are categorical. DoWhy's CausalModel automatically handles them by converting to dummies? Or do I need to preprocess them? Because when using logistic regression for propensity scores, categorical variables need to be one-hot encoded. However, DoWhy's CausalModel might handle that internally when estimating the propensity scores. So I think it's okay to pass them as strings, and the library will take care of encoding them as part of the process.\n\nSo the code should include all the categorical variables as they are in the common_causes list. \n\nTesting this with the first 10 rows, but since the actual data is larger, the code will process the whole dataset.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe function would read the data, create the CausalModel with the specified parameters, identify the effect, estimate using propensity score weighting, and return the value rounded to two decimal places.\n\nNow, let me check if there's any other parameters needed. The method_params for estimate_effect: for propensity score weighting, the weighting_scheme can be specified. The default is ips_weight, but since the user didn't specify, we can proceed with default. Also, in the code, when calling estimate_effect, the method_name is \"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\".\n\nFinally, the answer is the value from the estimate, rounded to two decimals.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('learning_mindset.csv')\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment='intervention',\n        outcome='achievement_score',\n        common_causes=[\n            'success_expect', 'ethnicity', 'gender', 'frst_in_family',\n            'school_urbanicity', 'school_mindset', 'school_achievement',\n            'school_ethnic_minority', 'school_poverty', 'school_size'\n        ]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    estimate = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n        method_params={\"weighting_scheme\": \"ips_weight\"}\n    )\n    return round(estimate.value, 2)\n\nWait, but the problem says to use logistic regression to estimate the propensity scores. Does DoWhy's propensity score weighting method use logistic regression? From the DoWhy documentation, when the treatment is binary, it uses logistic regression by default to estimate the propensity scores. So that's covered.\n\nYes, so the code is correct. Then, return the rounded value.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('learning_mindset.csv')\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment='intervention',\n        outcome='achievement_score',\n        common_causes=[\n            'success_expect', 'ethnicity', 'gender', 'frst_in_family',\n            'school_urbanicity', 'school_mindset', 'school_achievement',\n            'school_ethnic_minority', 'school_poverty', 'school_size'\n        ]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    estimate = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n        method_params={\"weighting_scheme\": \"ips_weight\"}\n    )\n    return round(estimate.value, 2)\n```"}
