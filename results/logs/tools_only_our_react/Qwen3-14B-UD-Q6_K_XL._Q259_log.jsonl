{"role": "user", "content": "You are a data analyst and good at causal reasoning. You are required to respond to a causal question using the \nprovided data. Be prepared for multiple choice and numerical questions. \n\nThe question may be a causal discovery question multiple choice question. \nIn that case, you should reason about the meanings of each variable and use knowledge of the situation to determine the causal relationship. Some variables may not be clearly named, so identify what they mean in the context of the dataset.\nYou may write code to analyze the data, however you should rely on the semantic meaning of the situation primarily and properties of the data secondarily when determining causal relationships. Some questions may have you identify whether variables should be used in \nestimating treatment effects. In that case you can run experiments, and think about tradeoffs.\n\nIf the question is numerical, you should generally follow this methodology:\nThe description and the question can be found below. Please analyze the first 10 rows of the table and write \npython code to analyze the whole table. You should use the DoWhy or causalinference library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation. The steps you should take are: \n1. Identify treatment and effect.\n2. Identify which method to use to estimate the effect, for example outcome modeling, propensity scores, difference in differences, instrumental variables, etc.\n3. Identify which tools to use. For example, for propensity score matching you could use causalinference CausalModel, and for outcome modelling you could use Dowhy CausalModel with backdoor.linear_regression.\n4. Identify variables to adjust for. These could be confounders/common causes, instrumental variables, etc.\n5. Identify how (if necessary) to transform the data. For example, in difference in differences, you would need to separate the data based on time and treatment.\n6. Write code to estimate the effect and return it.\nYou do not have to use dowhy or causalinference. Some of the datasets may be structured such that the treatment effect can be calculated from simple pandas methods, and some might be simpler with other libraries. You have access to Dowhy, causalinference, pandas, scipy, econml, sklearn, and causal-learn. For example, difference in differences does not require any use of dowhy effect estimation.\nThe returned value of the program should be the answer. After the solution function is written, don't write any more code and enter ```. The solution() function MUST be defined. The general format of the code (in an example of outcome modeling with dowhy) should be\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(filename)\n\n    #filter or transform data as necessary\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"treatment_col\"\n        outcome = \"outcome_col\"\n        common_causes = [\"causes\"]\n        instruments = [\"instruments\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=...)\n    return answer.value\n```\nHere are some examples of how to implement different causal models.\n        \nDoWhy: Different estimation methods for causal inference\nThis is a quick introduction to the DoWhy causal inference library. We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Outcome estimation\nUse linear regression.\n\nmodel = dowhy.CausalModel(\n    data=df\n    treatment=\"treatment_col\"\n    outcome=\"outcome_col\"\n    common_causes=[...] #confounders. Be careful to include the right variables here!\n)\n\nidentified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nAlternatively, you could use the causalinference library, which supports bias adjustment. \n\ncm = causalinference.CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"outcome\"].values, \n    D=med[\"treatment\"].values, \n    X=med[[confounders]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nreturn cm.estimates[\"matching\"][\"ate\"]\n\n\nMethod 3: Difference in differences\nSeperate the data into the treated and control groups at the different time steps.\n\nfilter = lambda a, b: df[\"outcome\"].where(df[\"time\"]==a & df[\"treatment\"]==b)\n\ntreated_before, treated_after, control_before, control_after = filter(0, 1), filter(1, 1), filter(0, 0), filter(1, 0)\n\nreturn (treated_after.mean()-treated_before.mean())-(control_after.mean()-control_before.mean())\n\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\n                                              \nMethod 5: Propensity Score Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\n                                            \nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\n        \nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\n\n\nMethod 8: Doubly Robust Estimation\nCombine outcome modelling and propensity scores. Here is an example using sklearn\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, LinearRegression\n\ndef doubly_robust(df, X, T, Y):\n    ps = LogisticRegression(C=1e6, max_iter=1000).fit(df[X], df[T]).predict_proba(df[X])[:, 1]\n    mu0 = LinearRegression().fit(df.query(f\"{T}==0\")[X], df.query(f\"{T}==0\")[Y]).predict(df[X])\n    mu1 = LinearRegression().fit(df.query(f\"{T}==1\")[X], df.query(f\"{T}==1\")[Y]).predict(df[X])\n    return (\n        np.mean(df[T]*(df[Y] - mu1)/ps + mu1) -\n        np.mean((1-df[T])*(df[Y] - mu0)/(1-ps) + mu0)\n    )\n                       \n\n        \nData Description:\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of email marketing on customer investment decisions, the dataset invest_email_rnd_train.csv is used for training, and invest_email_rnd_train.csv is used for testing. They contain customer data including id, age, income, insurance, invested amount, binary indicators for whether they received three different emails (em1, em2, em3), and a binary outcome variable indicating whether the customer converted (invested vs. didn't invest) after receiving an email. The goal is to personalize email marketing by sending email-1 only to customers predicted to have the highest increase in the probability of conversion.\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\ninvest_email_rnd_train:\nid   age   income  insurance  invested  em1  em2  em3  converted\n7940   1782  38.1  3789.26   71395.16   6469.34    0    1    1          0\n1162   3246  37.5  2113.26   49923.43   1731.41    0    0    1          0\n582    9315  36.1  2067.76   29695.50   3186.73    0    0    1          0\n4081  10359  37.4  1528.32   51424.72   3857.32    1    0    1          1\n8412   8626  38.0  1356.13   10409.41   4202.19    0    1    1          0\n8730  11515  47.8  7815.25   32559.67  14440.90    0    0    1          0\n5936  11819  37.9  2175.42   54276.21   6156.04    0    0    0          0\n8283   3943  40.9  1563.90  108028.33   5523.61    1    0    0          0\n3706   1432  42.7  1218.24   60948.16   2178.72    1    0    1          0\n4071    125  45.3  6991.90   18682.02  17516.34    1    1    1          0\ninvest_email_rnd_test:\nid   age   income  insurance  invested  em1  em2  em3  converted\n1782  14641  40.9  3421.98   43245.23   2501.94    1    0    0          0\n3917  11310  44.2  4937.46   17175.45  21334.17    0    0    1          1\n221    9415  38.9  2008.01    8044.99   3020.38    0    1    1          0\n2135   7144  45.2  7088.43   17552.29   6255.23    0    0    1          0\n5224   7254  48.2  1155.52   41638.58   4633.66    0    0    1          0\n1168   3441  49.0  8112.72   14756.51  11275.42    1    0    0          0\n879    5268  35.2  6792.22   72433.90   8463.04    1    0    1          0\n156   10979  42.3  4237.88    5271.65   7146.82    0    0    1          0\n1657   8775  41.0  3089.13    4563.68   3206.41    0    0    1          1\n323   14037  37.8  1637.90      94.66   1963.70    1    0    1          0\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the predicted increase in the probability that customer 6958 will purchase the investment product, if they are sent email-1?
