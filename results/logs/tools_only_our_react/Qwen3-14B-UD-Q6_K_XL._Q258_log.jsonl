{"role": "user", "content": "You are a data analyst and good at causal reasoning. You are required to respond to a causal question using the \nprovided data. Be prepared for multiple choice and numerical questions. \n\nThe question may be a causal discovery question multiple choice question. \nIn that case, you should reason about the meanings of each variable and use knowledge of the situation to determine the causal relationship. Some variables may not be clearly named, so identify what they mean in the context of the dataset.\nYou may write code to analyze the data, however you should rely on the semantic meaning of the situation primarily and properties of the data secondarily when determining causal relationships. Some questions may have you identify whether variables should be used in \nestimating treatment effects. In that case you can run experiments, and think about tradeoffs.\n\nIf the question is numerical, you should generally follow this methodology:\nThe description and the question can be found below. Please analyze the first 10 rows of the table and write \npython code to analyze the whole table. You should use the DoWhy or causalinference library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation. The steps you should take are: \n1. Identify treatment and effect.\n2. Identify which method to use to estimate the effect, for example outcome modeling, propensity scores, difference in differences, instrumental variables, etc.\n3. Identify which tools to use. For example, for propensity score matching you could use causalinference CausalModel, and for outcome modelling you could use Dowhy CausalModel with backdoor.linear_regression.\n4. Identify variables to adjust for. These could be confounders/common causes, instrumental variables, etc.\n5. Identify how (if necessary) to transform the data. For example, in difference in differences, you would need to separate the data based on time and treatment.\n6. Write code to estimate the effect and return it.\nYou do not have to use dowhy or causalinference. Some of the datasets may be structured such that the treatment effect can be calculated from simple pandas methods, and some might be simpler with other libraries. You have access to Dowhy, causalinference, pandas, scipy, econml, sklearn, and causal-learn. For example, difference in differences does not require any use of dowhy effect estimation.\nThe returned value of the program should be the answer. After the solution function is written, don't write any more code and enter ```. The solution() function MUST be defined. The general format of the code (in an example of outcome modeling with dowhy) should be\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(filename)\n\n    #filter or transform data as necessary\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"treatment_col\"\n        outcome = \"outcome_col\"\n        common_causes = [\"causes\"]\n        instruments = [\"instruments\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=...)\n    return answer.value\n```\nHere are some examples of how to implement different causal models.\n        \nDoWhy: Different estimation methods for causal inference\nThis is a quick introduction to the DoWhy causal inference library. We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Outcome estimation\nUse linear regression.\n\nmodel = dowhy.CausalModel(\n    data=df\n    treatment=\"treatment_col\"\n    outcome=\"outcome_col\"\n    common_causes=[...] #confounders. Be careful to include the right variables here!\n)\n\nidentified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nAlternatively, you could use the causalinference library, which supports bias adjustment. \n\ncm = causalinference.CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"outcome\"].values, \n    D=med[\"treatment\"].values, \n    X=med[[confounders]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nreturn cm.estimates[\"matching\"][\"ate\"]\n\n\nMethod 3: Difference in differences\nSeperate the data into the treated and control groups at the different time steps.\n\nfilter = lambda a, b: df[\"outcome\"].where(df[\"time\"]==a & df[\"treatment\"]==b)\n\ntreated_before, treated_after, control_before, control_after = filter(0, 1), filter(1, 1), filter(0, 0), filter(1, 0)\n\nreturn (treated_after.mean()-treated_before.mean())-(control_after.mean()-control_before.mean())\n\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\n                                              \nMethod 5: Propensity Score Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\n                                            \nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\n        \nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\n\n\nMethod 8: Doubly Robust Estimation\nCombine outcome modelling and propensity scores. Here is an example using sklearn\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, LinearRegression\n\ndef doubly_robust(df, X, T, Y):\n    ps = LogisticRegression(C=1e6, max_iter=1000).fit(df[X], df[T]).predict_proba(df[X])[:, 1]\n    mu0 = LinearRegression().fit(df.query(f\"{T}==0\")[X], df.query(f\"{T}==0\")[Y]).predict(df[X])\n    mu1 = LinearRegression().fit(df.query(f\"{T}==1\")[X], df.query(f\"{T}==1\")[Y]).predict(df[X])\n    return (\n        np.mean(df[T]*(df[Y] - mu1)/ps + mu1) -\n        np.mean((1-df[T])*(df[Y] - mu0)/(1-ps) + mu0)\n    )\n                       \n\n        \nData Description:\nTo estimate the impacts of alcohol on death, we could use the fact that legal drinking age imposes a discontinuity on nature.
