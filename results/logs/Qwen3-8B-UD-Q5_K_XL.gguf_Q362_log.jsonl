The purpose of the analysis is to estimate the effect of education on wage, using linear regression and quarter of birth as an instrumental variable (IV). This idea takes advantage of US compulsory attendance law. Usually, they state that a kid must have turned 6 years by January 1 of the year they enter school. For this reason, kids that are born at the beginning of the year will enter school at an older age. Compulsory attendance law also requires students to be in school until they turn 16, at which point they are legally allowed to drop out. The result is that people born later in the year have, on average, more years of education than those born in the beginning of the year.\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nak91:\nlog_wage  years_of_schooling  ...  quarter_of_birth  state_of_birth\n12663   5.657537                12.0  ...               2.0            37.0\n186092  5.729413                12.0  ...               4.0            26.0\n323078  5.971311                12.0  ...               4.0            26.0\n152372  6.047781                10.0  ...               4.0            17.0\n94610   5.952494                 8.0  ...               4.0            28.0\n124647  5.901214                12.0  ...               4.0            40.0\n255146  5.605873                12.0  ...               4.0            55.0\n93625   6.357876                13.0  ...               4.0            51.0\n80347   5.237107                 8.0  ...               3.0            36.0\n291350  5.818998                11.0  ...               4.0             5.0\n\n[10 rows x 5 columns]\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education based on the instrumental variable of whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4?

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to estimate the effect of education on wage using an instrumental variable, specifically quarter of birth. The dataset is ak91.csv, and the first 10 rows are provided. Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, the question asks for the average additional percentage wage increase per additional year of education, using the IV method with quarter_of_birth as the instrument. They mention adjusting for all other variables, so I need to include those in the model.\n\nLet me recall the DoWhy steps. The user wants me to use the DoWhy library to build a causal model. The steps are: identify treatment, outcome, common causes, instruments, and effect modifiers. Then construct the model and estimate the effect.\n\nSo, the treatment here is years_of_schooling. The outcome is log_wage. The instrument is quarter_of_birth. Wait, but the question says \"whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4\". Wait, the variable quarter_of_birth is a numerical value (like 1, 2, 3, 4). So maybe the instrument is whether quarter_of_birth is 4? But the data shows quarter_of_birth as 2.0, 4.0, etc. So maybe the instrument is the quarter_of_birth variable, and we need to use it as an IV. However, the question says to use \"whether born in the last quarter q4\" as the instrument. So perhaps the instrument is a binary variable indicating if the quarter is 4. But the dataset has quarter_of_birth as a continuous variable. Wait, maybe the original variable is categorical, but in the data, it's stored as 1, 2, 3, 4. So maybe the instrument is the quarter_of_birth, and we need to use it as a categorical variable. However, in the DoWhy model, instruments are variables that affect the treatment. So in this case, the quarter_of_birth is the instrument. But the problem says to use q4 as the instrument. So perhaps the instrument is a binary variable, say, whether the quarter is 4. Wait, but the data has quarter_of_birth as a continuous variable. Maybe the original data has quarter_of_birth as a categorical variable. Let me check the data description again.\n\nThe data has quarter_of_birth as a column with values like 2.0, 4.0, etc. So it's a numeric variable with possible values 1, 2, 3, 4. The instrument is supposed to be the quarter of birth. So in the context of the IV approach, the quarter_of_birth variable is the instrument. However, in the standard IV setup, the instrument is a binary variable. But here, the instrument is categorical. However, the DoWhy library can handle this as an instrument. Wait, but the user mentioned that the IV is whether the individual is born in q4. So perhaps the instrument is a binary variable indicating if the quarter is 4. But the dataset has quarter_of_birth as a continuous variable. So maybe we need to create a binary variable for q4. But the data may not have that. Let me check the data. The first 10 rows have quarter_of_birth as 2.0, 4.0, etc. So if the instrument is q4, then the instrument variable is a binary variable that is 1 if quarter is 4, else 0. However, in the data, the variable is stored as quarter_of_birth. So maybe the user intended to use the quarter_of_birth as the instrument, treating it as a categorical variable. But the problem says to use the IV of whether the individual is born in q4. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"using linear regression and quarter of birth as an instrumental variable (IV). This idea takes advantage of US compulsory attendance law.\" So the IV is quarter of birth. The problem also says \"whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4\" as the instrument. Wait, maybe the instrument is the quarter_of_birth, and the user wants to use it as an IV. But the problem says \"whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4\" as the IV. So perhaps the instrument is a binary variable indicating if the quarter is 4. So maybe the actual instrument is a binary variable. However, in the data, the quarter_of_birth is a numeric variable. So perhaps we need to create a new variable, say, q4 = 1 if quarter_of_birth == 4, else 0. But the problem says \"quarter_of_birth as an instrumental variable (IV)\". So perhaps the original variable is the instrument. But in the data, it's stored as a numeric variable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the quarter_of_birth as the instrument. For example, in the IV approach, the quarter_of_birth is an instrument that affects the treatment (years_of_schooling). The instrument is the quarter_of_birth, which is a categorical variable. So in the DoWhy model, the instrument would be the quarter_of_birth variable. However, the problem says \"whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4\". That might imply that the instrument is a binary variable (1 for q4, 0 otherwise). But the data has quarter_of_birth as a continuous variable. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the data has quarter_of_birth as a numeric variable, perhaps the user intended to use it as the instrument. So I should treat quarter_of_birth as the instrument. \n\nBut the question says \"using the instrumental variable of whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4\". That suggests that the instrument is a binary variable indicating q4. So maybe the instrument is a binary variable, and the data's quarter_of_birth is stored as 1, 2, 3, 4. So we need to create a binary variable for q4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the quarter_of_birth as the instrument, and the IV is the quarter_of_birth. But how does that work? The IV is supposed to affect the treatment (education), but in this case, the quarter_of_birth is a variable that is supposed to influence the treatment (education). So in the data, the quarter_of_birth is the instrument. So the instrument is quarter_of_birth, and the treatment is years_of_schooling. \n\nBut then, the IV method would use the instrument to estimate the causal effect of education on wage. \n\nSo, for the DoWhy model, the treatment is years_of_schooling, the outcome is log_wage. The instrument is quarter_of_birth. The common causes would be the variables that affect both treatment and outcome. In this case, the variables that are confounders. The problem mentions that we need to adjust for all other variables. The other variables are year_of_birth, state_of_birth. So perhaps the common causes are year_of_birth and state_of_birth. \n\nWait, the data has variables: log_wage, years_of_schooling, year_of_birth, quarter_of_birth, state_of_birth. \n\nIn the IV setup, the instrument (quarter_of_birth) affects the treatment (years_of_schooling), and the treatment affects the outcome (log_wage). However, there might be confounding variables that affect both treatment and outcome. For example, year_of_birth might be a confounder. Also, state_of_birth could be a confounder. \n\nSo the common causes would be year_of_birth and state_of_birth. \n\nBut wait, the problem says to adjust for all other variables. So the common causes are variables that affect both treatment and outcome. So in the dataset, the variables that are not the treatment, outcome, or instrument are year_of_birth, state_of_birth, and the other variables. Wait, the dataset includes log_wage, years_of_schooling, year_of_birth, quarter_of_birth, state_of_birth. \n\nSo the treatment is years_of_schooling. The outcome is log_wage. The instrument is quarter_of_birth. The common causes are the variables that are confounders. So year_of_birth and state_of_birth might be confounders. Because they can affect both education and wage. For example, someone born in a later year might have different opportunities. Also, state_of_birth could affect access to education. \n\nTherefore, in the DoWhy model, the common causes would be year_of_birth and state_of_birth. \n\nThe instruments are the quarter_of_birth. \n\nSo the model would be:\n\ntreatment: years_of_schooling\n\noutcome: log_wage\n\ncommon causes: year_of_birth, state_of_birth\n\ninstruments: quarter_of_birth\n\nWait, but the IV method requires that the instrument is exogenous and affects the treatment. So the instrument is quarter_of_birth, which is a valid IV. \n\nSo, the code should create a CausalModel with these parameters. \n\nNow, the next step is to use the DoWhy library to perform the estimation. \n\nThe code structure would be:\n\nRead the data.\n\nCreate the CausalModel with treatment, outcome, common causes, and instruments.\n\nIdentify the effect.\n\nEstimate the effect using IV methods. \n\nThe method to use here is instrumental variable. In DoWhy, for IV, the method name would be \"iv.instrumental_variable\". \n\nBut wait, the DoWhy documentation says that for IV, the method name is \"iv.instrumental_variable\". So the estimate_effect function would use that. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nmodel = CausalModel(\n    data = data,\n    treatment = \"years_of_schooling\",\n    outcome = \"log_wage\",\n    common_causes = [\"year_of_birth\", \"state_of_birth\"],\n    instruments = [\"quarter_of_birth\"]\n)\n\nThen, identify the effect. Then estimate using IV method. \n\nBut the problem says to adjust for all other variables. Are there any other variables? The data has log_wage, years_of_schooling, year_of_birth, quarter_of_birth, state_of_birth. So the other variables are year_of_birth and state_of_birth, which are already included as common causes. \n\nSo the code should proceed as such. \n\nBut wait, the user might have to check if the variables are correctly named. Let me check the data again. The first 10 rows have columns named:\n\nlog_wage, years_of_schooling, ... (then other columns). The actual column names are:\n\nlog_wage, years_of_schooling, year_of_birth, quarter_of_birth, state_of_birth. \n\nWait, in the first 10 rows, the columns are:\n\nlog_wage  years_of_schooling  ...  quarter_of_birth  state_of_birth\n\nSo the columns are: log_wage, years_of_schooling, year_of_birth, quarter_of_birth, state_of_birth. \n\nYes. So the treatment is years_of_schooling, outcome is log_wage, instruments are quarter_of_birth, common causes are year_of_birth and state_of_birth. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('ak91.csv')\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"years_of_schooling\",\n        outcome = \"log_wage\",\n        common_causes = [\"year_of_birth\", \"state_of_birth\"],\n        instruments = [\"quarter_of_birth\"]\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\"\n    )\n    return answer.value\n\nWait, but the question asks for the average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education. The log_wage is the outcome. So the estimated effect is the coefficient of years_of_schooling in the IV regression. \n\nBut the answer needs to be in percentage terms. Since log_wage is in log scale, the coefficient can be interpreted as a percentage change. For example, if the coefficient is 0.05, then each additional year of education increases the wage by 5% (since the log of wage is the outcome). \n\nBut the question says to round to the nearest hundredth of a percent. So if the estimated effect is 0.05, that would be 5.00%, so the answer would be 5.00. \n\nBut the problem says \"average additional percentage wage increase\". So the coefficient of years_of_schooling in the IV regression is the estimate. \n\nBut the DoWhy model's estimate_effect would return this coefficient. \n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the DoWhy library's IV method may require certain conditions. \n\nAnother thing to note: in the data, the quarter_of_birth is a numeric variable. The instrument is supposed to be a variable that affects the treatment. So the code should work. \n\nBut what if the instrument is not a binary variable? The DoWhy IV method can handle that. \n\nAnother thing: the problem says to adjust for all other variables. The common_causes are year_of_birth and state_of_birth, which are included. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, the answer should be the value of the causal effect. The code returns answer.value. \n\nBut the problem says \"average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education\". So the coefficient from the IV regression is the answer. \n\nBut wait, log_wage is the outcome. So the coefficient would represent the change in log wage per additional year of education. To convert this to a percentage, we can exponentiate the coefficient, subtract 1, and multiply by 100. However, since the question says \"average additional percentage wage increase\", the coefficient itself can be interpreted as the percentage change if the model is in log wage. \n\nFor example, if the coefficient is 0.05, then each additional year of education increases log wage by 0.05, which is equivalent to a 5% increase in wage (since e^0.05 \u00e2\u0089\u0088 1.05127, so a 5.127% increase). However, the problem may be expecting the coefficient as the percentage change, which would be 5% (approximating). \n\nBut the exact value would depend on the data. \n\nBut according to the problem's question, the answer should be the estimated effect, which is the coefficient from the IV regression. \n\nSo the code as written should return that value. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the DoWhy method is correctly applied. \n\nAnother thing to check: the DoWhy model may require the instrument to be a valid IV. For example, the instrument must satisfy the exclusion restriction (it affects the treatment but not the outcome directly). But in the model, the common causes are included, so the model assumes that the instrument is valid. \n\nSo the code should be correct. \n\nNow, the code should read the data, create the model, estimate the effect, and return the value. \n\nBut the user mentioned that the first 10 rows are provided, but the code needs to process the entire dataset. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, the answer is the value of the estimated effect, which is the coefficient. \n\nSo the code should return that value. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education\". The coefficient from the IV regression is the estimated effect. If the coefficient is, say, 0.05, then the answer is 5.00%. \n\nSo the code should return that value. \n\nBut the code as written would return answer.value, which is the coefficient. \n\nSo the final answer would be the value of answer.value, rounded to two decimal places as per the question. \n\nBut the code as written does not round. So perhaps after getting the value, we need to round it to two decimal places. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a percent\". So the answer should be a percentage value, rounded to two decimal places. \n\nSo for example, if the coefficient is 0.05, the answer is 5.00. \n\nBut in the code, the answer.value is the coefficient. So to convert it to a percentage, we multiply by 100. \n\nWait, this is a key point. \n\nThe outcome is log_wage. The coefficient from the IV regression would be the change in log_wage per additional year of education. To convert this to a percentage change, we can exponentiate the coefficient. For example, if the coefficient is 0.05, then the percentage change is (e^0.05 - 1) * 100 \u00e2\u0089\u0088 5.127%. \n\nBut the problem says \"average additional percentage wage increase\", which might be interpreted as the percentage change. However, in some contexts, the coefficient itself is considered as the percentage change if the model is linear in log wages. \n\nBut this is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the question is using the term \"percentage wage increase\", the correct approach is to convert the coefficient to a percentage. \n\nBut how is the coefficient interpreted? \n\nIn a linear regression of log_wage on years_of_schooling, the coefficient is the percentage change in wage per additional year of education. For example, if the coefficient is 0.05, then each additional year of education increases wage by 5%. \n\nBut this is an approximation. So if the model is log_wage = beta * years_of_schooling + ... , then the coefficient beta is the percentage change. \n\nSo in this case, the answer is the coefficient multiplied by 100. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe model is log(wage) = beta * years_of_schooling + ... \n\nThe coefficient beta is the change in log(wage) per additional year of education. \n\nThe percentage change in wage is approximated by beta * 100%. \n\nFor example, if beta is 0.05, then a 1 unit increase in years_of_schooling leads to a 5% increase in wage. \n\nBut this is an approximation. So the coefficient is the percentage change. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the estimated coefficient multiplied by 100. \n\nBut in the code, the DoWhy estimate_effect returns the coefficient (the effect of treatment on outcome). So the answer would be the value of the coefficient multiplied by 100. \n\nWait, no. The problem says the outcome is log_wage. The estimated effect is the change in log_wage per additional year of education. So the answer is the coefficient (from the IV regression) multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. \n\nBut the problem says \"average additional percentage wage increase\", which is the coefficient multiplied by 100. \n\nSo the code needs to multiply the answer.value by 100 and round to two decimal places. \n\nSo the code should be adjusted to do that. \n\nBut wait, the code as written returns answer.value. But according to the problem's requirement, the answer should be the percentage change. \n\nSo, for example, if answer.value is 0.05, then the answer is 5.00. \n\nSo the code should multiply the answer.value by 100. \n\nBut how does the DoWhy library handle this? Let's think. \n\nThe DoWhy's estimate_effect method returns the causal effect. For the IV method, it would return the coefficient of the treatment (years_of_schooling) in the IV regression. So that coefficient is the effect. \n\nIf the outcome is log_wage, then this coefficient is the percentage change in wage per additional year of education. So the answer is the coefficient multiplied by 100. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nIf the model is log(wage) = beta * years + ... \n\nThen, the percentage change in wage is approximately beta * 100% (since exp(beta) \u00e2\u0089\u0088 1 + beta for small beta). \n\nSo the coefficient beta is the percentage change per year. \n\nTherefore, the answer is answer.value * 100. \n\nSo, in the code, after getting the answer.value, we multiply it by 100 and round to two decimal places. \n\nSo, in the code, the return should be round(answer.value * 100, 2). \n\nBut the question says to round to the nearest hundredth of a percent. So the answer should be in the format of x.xx, where xx are the hundredths. \n\nTherefore, the code should be modified to return answer.value * 100, rounded. \n\nBut wait, what if the answer.value is, say, 0.05 (which is 5% per year)? Then the code returns 5.00. \n\nSo the code should do that. \n\nTherefore, the final code would be:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('ak91.csv')\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"years_of_schooling\",\n        outcome = \"log_wage\",\n        common_causes = [\"year_of_birth\", \"state_of_birth\"],\n        instruments = [\"quarter_of_birth\"]\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\"\n    )\n    return round(answer.value * 100, 2)\n\nBut I need to check if the code is correct. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the DoWhy IV method might require specifying the instrument as a binary variable. However, the data's quarter_of_birth is a numeric variable with values 1, 2, 3, 4. So it's categorical. But in the IV method, the instrument can be a categorical variable. However, the DoWhy library might assume that the instrument is binary. \n\nWait, the DoWhy documentation says that the IV method is for the case where the instrument is binary. However, in the case of a categorical instrument, the code might not work. \n\nWait, the problem says that the IV is whether the individual is born in q4. So the instrument is a binary variable. However, in the data, the quarter_of_birth is stored as a numeric variable with values 1, 2, 3, 4. So if we treat quarter_of_birth as a binary variable, we need to create a new variable that is 1 if quarter_of_birth is 4, else 0. \n\nBut the problem says that the instrument is quarter_of_birth. So perhaps the original dataset has the quarter_of_birth as a binary variable. But in the given data, the first 10 rows have quarter_of_birth as 2.0, 4.0, etc. So it's a numeric variable, not binary. \n\nThis is a problem. So the code as written assumes that quarter_of_birth is the instrument, but it's a categorical variable, not binary. \n\nIn this case, the IV method may not be applicable directly. Because the IV method typically uses a binary instrument. However, the DoWhy library may handle categorical instruments. \n\nWait, the DoWhy IV method can handle multiple instruments, but for the instrumental variable method, the instrument is typically a binary variable. However, the code as written would treat the quarter_of_birth as the instrument, which is a numeric variable. \n\nThis could be an issue. \n\nBut the problem says that the IV is whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4. So perhaps the instrument is a binary variable indicating whether the quarter is 4. So in that case, we need to create a new column in the data that is 1 if quarter_of_birth is 4, else 0. \n\nSo the code should create a new variable, say 'q4', which is 1 when quarter_of_birth ==4. Then, the instrument is this new variable. \n\nBut the original data may not have this column. So the code would need to create it. \n\nBut the problem's data description says that the data contains quarter_of_birth as a variable. So the user may have to preprocess the data to create the binary instrument. \n\nBut the problem says to use the IV of whether the individual is born in q4. So the instrument is a binary variable. \n\nSo the code should create this variable. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to create a new column in the data, say 'is_q4', which is 1 if quarter_of_birth is 4, else 0. Then, the instrument is this new variable. \n\nBut the original code uses 'quarter_of_birth' as the instrument. Which is incorrect. \n\nThis is a critical mistake. \n\nSo the correct steps are:\n\n- Create a new binary variable 'is_q4' which is 1 if quarter_of_birth ==4, else 0. \n\n- Use 'is_q4' as the instrument. \n\nBut the problem says that the instrument is whether the individual is born in q4. Therefore, the code should use this binary variable as the instrument. \n\nSo in the code, after reading the data, we should create this new variable. \n\nTherefore, the code should include:\n\ndata['is_q4'] = (data['quarter_of_birth'] == 4).astype(int)\n\nThen, the instrument is 'is_q4'. \n\nBut the original data has 'quarter_of_birth' as a numeric variable. \n\nThis is important. \n\nSo the code should be adjusted to create this binary variable. \n\nBut the problem statement says that the user is supposed to use the IV of whether the individual is born in q4. So the instrument is this binary variable. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('ak91.csv')\n\n    # Create binary instrument for q4\n    data['is_q4'] = (data['quarter_of_birth'] == 4).astype(int)\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"years_of_schooling\",\n        outcome = \"log_wage\",\n        common_causes = [\"year_of_birth\", \"state_of_birth\"],\n        instruments = [\"is_q4\"]\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\"\n    )\n    return round(answer.value * 100, 2)\n\nBut this would be the correct approach. \n\nHowever, the original question's first 10 rows show the quarter_of_birth as 2.0, 4.0, etc. So the code creates 'is_q4' as 1 for those rows where quarter_of_birth is 4. \n\nThis is essential because the IV method requires the instrument to be binary. \n\nThis is a critical correction. \n\nTherefore, the previous code was incorrect, and the correct code should include creating the binary instrument. \n\nBut the problem's initial data description says that the instrument is quarter_of_birth. However, the question says that the IV is whether the individual is born in q4. So the instrument is a binary variable. \n\nTherefore, the code must create the binary instrument. \n\nThis is a key point that I missed earlier. \n\nSo now, the code should include creating the 'is_q4' variable. \n\nBut the problem says \"quarter_of_birth as an instrumental variable (IV)\", but the question says to use whether the individual is born in q4 as the IV. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nBut based on the question's wording, the correct approach is to use the binary variable indicating q4 as the instrument. \n\nTherefore, the code should include creating this binary variable. \n\nThus, the code should be adjusted accordingly. \n\nAnother thing: in the data, the quarter_of_birth is a numeric variable, so checking for equality to 4 is correct. \n\nSo the code now includes creating the binary variable. \n\nThis is important for the IV method to work. \n\nNow, the code should be correct. \n\nSo the final code is:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('ak91.csv')\n\n    # Create binary instrument for q4\n    data['is_q4'] = (data['quarter_of_birth'] == 4).astype(int)\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"years_of_schooling\",\n        outcome = \"log_wage\",\n        common_causes = [\"year_of_birth\", \"state_of_birth\"],\n        instruments = [\"is_q4\"]\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\"\n    )\n    return round(answer.value * 100, 2)\n\nBut now, the code includes creating the binary instrument. \n\nThus, the answer should be the value of the coefficient from the IV regression multiplied by 100, rounded to two decimal places. \n\nThis should be the correct approach.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('ak91.csv')\n\n    # Create binary instrument for q4\n    data['is_q4'] = (data['quarter_of_birth'] == 4).astype(int)\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"years_of_schooling\",\n        outcome = \"log_wage\",\n        common_causes = [\"year_of_birth\", \"state_of_birth\"],\n        instruments = [\"is_q4\"]\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\"\n    )\n    return round(answer.value * 100, 2)\n```"}

We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Regression\nUse linear regression.\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nMethod 3: Propensity Score Stratification\nWe will be using propensity scores to stratify units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_strat = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_stratification\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\")\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\nAlternatively, Causalinference has a simple way to train bias adjusted matching estimators:\nfrom causalinference import CausalModel\n\ncm = CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"recovery\"].values, \n    D=med[\"medication\"].values, \n    X=med[[\"severity\", \"age\", \"sex\"]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nprint(cm.estimates)\n\nMethod 5: Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\nData Description:\nThe dataset provided, ak91.csv, contains information on individuals' log wages, years of schooling, year of birth, quarter of birth, and state of birth. The purpose of the analysis is to estimate the effect of education on wage, using linear regression and quarter of birth as an instrumental variable (IV). This idea takes advantage of US compulsory attendance law. Usually, they state that a kid must have turned 6 years by January 1 of the year they enter school. For this reason, kids that are born at the beginning of the year will enter school at an older age. Compulsory attendance law also requires students to be in school until they turn 16, at which point they are legally allowed to drop out. The result is that people born later in the year have, on average, more years of education than those born in the beginning of the year.\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nak91:\nlog_wage  years_of_schooling  ...  quarter_of_birth  state_of_birth\n12663   5.657537                12.0  ...               2.0            37.0\n186092  5.729413                12.0  ...               4.0            26.0\n323078  5.971311                12.0  ...               4.0            26.0\n152372  6.047781                10.0  ...               4.0            17.0\n94610   5.952494                 8.0  ...               4.0            28.0\n124647  5.901214                12.0  ...               4.0            40.0\n255146  5.605873                12.0  ...               4.0            55.0\n93625   6.357876                13.0  ...               4.0            51.0\n80347   5.237107                 8.0  ...               3.0            36.0\n291350  5.818998                11.0  ...               4.0             5.0\n\n[10 rows x 5 columns]\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education based on the instrumental variable of whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4?

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to estimate the average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education using quarter of birth as an instrumental variable (IV). They also mentioned adjusting for other variables and rounding to the nearest hundredth of a percent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the data. The dataset ak91.csv has columns: log_wage, years_of_schooling, year_of_birth, quarter_of_birth, state_of_birth. The question is about the effect of education (years_of_schooling) on log_wage, using quarter_of_birth as an IV. The IV is q4, so I need to check if quarter_of_birth is coded as a categorical variable, maybe 1-4 for quarters. The problem says to adjust for other variables, which probably includes year_of_birth, state_of_birth, and maybe others.\n\nWait, the first 10 rows show quarter_of_birth as 2.0, 4.0, etc. So it's likely a categorical variable with values 1 to 4. But the IV is whether the individual is born in q4. So the treatment is the years_of_schooling, and the IV is quarter_of_birth, but maybe the IV is a binary indicator (like q4 vs not q4). Wait, the problem states that the IV is whether the individual is born in q4. So the instrumental variable is a binary variable indicating if the person was born in the last quarter (q4). So quarter_of_birth might be 1-4, and we need to create a binary variable for q4.\n\nBut the question says to use quarter_of_birth as the IV. So perhaps the treatment is the years_of_schooling, and the IV is the quarter_of_birth. However, IV methods require that the instrument affects the treatment and not the outcome directly. In this case, the instrument (quarter_of_birth) affects the treatment (years_of_schooling) via the compulsory education law. The outcome is log_wage.\n\nSo the approach here is to use instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Since the question mentions using the IV method, I should use the IV method in DoWhy.\n\nBut first, I need to structure the model. The treatment is years_of_schooling, the outcome is log_wage, and the instrument is quarter_of_birth (but maybe as a binary variable indicating q4). Wait, the IV is whether the individual is born in the last quarter (q4). So the instrument is a binary variable (1 if q4, 0 otherwise). However, in the data, quarter_of_birth is a continuous variable (1.0, 2.0, etc.), so I need to create a binary variable indicating q4 (quarter_of_birth == 4). So first, I should process the data to create an IV column that is 1 if quarter_of_birth is 4, else 0.\n\nBut the data might not have that. Let me check the first 10 rows. The quarter_of_birth values are 2.0, 4.0, etc. So, for each row, we can create an IV variable, say 'q4_indicator', which is 1 if quarter_of_birth == 4, else 0.\n\nOnce that's done, the next step is to use the IV method in DoWhy. The DoWhy CausalModel requires specifying treatment, outcome, and instrument. So the treatment is years_of_schooling, outcome is log_wage, and instrument is the q4_indicator. But wait, the IV method in DoWhy requires that the instrument is a variable that affects the treatment. So, the instrument is the q4_indicator, which is a binary variable.\n\nBut the problem says to adjust for all other variables. The other variables are year_of_birth, state_of_birth, and possibly others. So in the CausalModel, we need to specify common causes (confounders) as the variables that are related to both treatment and outcome. But since we are using an IV, the common causes should be variables that affect both treatment and outcome, but not the instrument. However, in this case, the instrument is the quarter_of_birth, which is a variable that affects the treatment (years_of_schooling) through the compulsory education law. Therefore, the instrument is not part of the common causes, but the other variables (year_of_birth, state_of_birth) might be confounders.\n\nWait, but in the IV approach, the instrument is not a common cause. So when using IV, the common causes are variables that are confounders (common causes of treatment and outcome) but not the instrument. Therefore, in the CausalModel, the common_causes would be the variables that are confounders, and the instrument is specified as the IV.\n\nSo, in the DoWhy model, the treatment is years_of_schooling, outcome is log_wage, instrument is the q4_indicator. The common_causes would be variables that affect both treatment and outcome, such as year_of_birth and state_of_birth. However, the problem says to adjust for all other variables. So perhaps the common_causes are year_of_birth, state_of_birth, and maybe others. Wait, the dataset has year_of_birth, quarter_of_birth, state_of_birth. So the variables to adjust for are year_of_birth and state_of_birth, as they are likely confounders (since they can affect both education and wages). The IV is quarter_of_birth, but we need to create a binary variable for q4.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Create a binary variable for q4 (quarter_of_birth == 4).\n2. Use this as the instrument in the DoWhy model.\n3. The treatment is years_of_schooling, outcome is log_wage.\n4. The common causes (confounders) are year_of_birth and state_of_birth.\n5. Use the IV method to estimate the causal effect.\n\nSo, in the code, first, process the data to create the instrument variable. Then, build the model with treatment, outcome, instrument, and common causes.\n\nBut wait, the DoWhy CausalModel's constructor requires the data, treatment, outcome, and optionally common_causes and instruments. So the common_causes would be the variables that are confounders (year_of_birth and state_of_birth). The instrument is the q4_indicator.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the data, create the q4_indicator, then set up the model.\n\nNow, the method to estimate the effect would be IV method. For the IV method, the method_name would be \"iv.instrumental_variable\".\n\nBut in the DoWhy documentation, the IV method uses the instrumental variable approach. So the code would be:\n\nmodel = CausalModel(\n    data=data,\n    treatment='years_of_schooling',\n    outcome='log_wage',\n    instruments=['q4_indicator'],\n    common_causes=['year_of_birth', 'state_of_birth']\n)\n\nThen identify the effect, and estimate using the IV method.\n\nWait, but the DoWhy CausalModel's constructor requires either a graph, common_causes, or instruments. In this case, since we are using IV, the instruments are specified. The common_causes are the confounders.\n\nThen, after identifying the effect, we call estimate_effect with method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\".\n\nBut in the example code provided, the user might need to adjust the code. Let me check the sample code again. For example, in the IV example, the code uses method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\" and specifies the instrument.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef solution():\n    import pandas as pd\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('ak91.csv')\n\n    # Create q4_indicator\n    data['q4_indicator'] = (data['quarter_of_birth'] == 4).astype(int)\n\n    # Define treatment, outcome, instrument, and common causes\n    treatment = 'years_of_schooling'\n    outcome = 'log_wage'\n    instruments = 'q4_indicator'\n    common_causes = ['year_of_birth', 'state_of_birth']\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment=treatment,\n        outcome=outcome,\n        instruments=instruments,\n        common_causes=common_causes\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\"\n    )\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n\nWait, but the question asks for the average additional percentage wage increase per year of education. Since log_wage is in log scale, the effect is in percentage terms. Wait, the problem says \"average additional percentage wage increase\", which suggests that the coefficient is the percentage increase. However, since the outcome is log_wage, the effect of a one-unit increase in education (years_of_schooling) would be the coefficient (since log(wage) = log(wage) + \u00ce\u00b2*education, so the coefficient is the percentage change in wage). Therefore, the answer is the coefficient from the IV estimation.\n\nBut the user wants the answer rounded to the nearest hundredth of a percent. So the code should return the coefficient as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut in the code above, the answer.value is the estimated effect. Let me check: the model.estimate_effect returns the effect as a numerical value. Since the outcome is log_wage, the effect is the coefficient (in percentage terms if the model is correctly specified).\n\nBut wait, when using IV, the model estimates the causal effect of the treatment (years_of_schooling) on the outcome (log_wage). The coefficient would represent the change in log_wage per one additional year of education. To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100, but the problem says \"average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education\". Since log_wage is the outcome, the effect is the percentage change. For example, if the coefficient is 0.05, that's a 5% increase in wage per additional year of education.\n\nBut the problem says to return the answer as the average additional percentage, which is the coefficient multiplied by 100. Wait, no. Wait, the coefficient in a log-linear model (log_wage) is the percentage change. For example, if log_wage = \u00ce\u00b2 * education + ..., then a one unit increase in education leads to an increase of \u00ce\u00b2 in log_wage, which corresponds to a (exp(\u00ce\u00b2) - 1) * 100% increase in wage. However, if the model is in log scale, and the effect is estimated as the coefficient, then the effect is the percentage change. However, this depends on the model specification.\n\nBut the question says to use linear regression and the IV method. Wait, the problem says \"using linear regression and quarter of birth as an instrumental variable (IV)\". Wait, the user's initial description says that the purpose is to estimate the effect of education on wage using linear regression and IV. Wait, but the first part of the problem says to use the DoWhy library, and the question is about using IV.\n\nBut according to the data description, the IV is quarter_of_birth. However, the IV approach in DoWhy would use the instrument (q4_indicator), and the model would be estimating the IV estimator, such as the Wald estimator.\n\nSo the code should use the IV method. However, in the code above, the model.estimate_effect is called with method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", which should correctly estimate the effect using IV.\n\nBut the problem says \"adjust for all the other variables\". So the common_causes are the variables that are confounders. In this case, the other variables are year_of_birth and state_of_birth. Therefore, the code includes those as common_causes.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the data, process the q4_indicator, and then set up the model.\n\nTesting this code would give the estimated effect. However, the user wants the answer rounded to the nearest hundredth of a percent. So the answer.value should be multiplied by 100 and rounded to two decimal places? Or is the answer.value already in percentage terms?\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the outcome is log_wage. The effect of education on log_wage is a coefficient, which represents the change in log_wage per additional year of education. If we exponentiate this coefficient, we get the multiplicative factor. For example, if the coefficient is 0.05, then the wage increases by e^0.05 \u00e2\u0089\u0088 5.13% per additional year. However, the question says \"average additional percentage wage increase\", so the answer is the coefficient multiplied by 100. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, if the model is using linear regression on log_wage, then the coefficient is the percentage change. For example, if the coefficient is 0.05, then the wage increases by 5% per additional year. But this is only true if the model is in the log scale, and the coefficient is the elasticity. However, in the case of a linear model, the coefficient would be the percentage change in the log scale. But the problem says to use the IV method and linear regression, so the code may use a linear model.\n\nBut the code using DoWhy's IV method would estimate the causal effect, which in this case would be the coefficient from the IV estimation. So the answer.value is the coefficient. Then, the problem says to return it as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the code should return answer.value * 100, rounded to two decimal places. Wait, but the problem says \"average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education\", which is the same as the coefficient in the log-linear model. For example, if the coefficient is 0.05, then the wage increases by 5% per additional year. Therefore, the answer.value is already the percentage. Wait, no. Because the coefficient is in log(wage) units. So, if you have log(wage) = \u00ce\u00b2 * education + ..., then \u00ce\u00b2 is the change in log(wage) per additional year of education. To get the percentage change, you can exponentiate \u00ce\u00b2 and subtract 1. For example, e^\u00ce\u00b2 - 1. However, if the coefficient is small (like 0.05), then e^0.05 - 1 \u00e2\u0089\u0088 0.0513, which is approximately 5.13%. But the problem says to return the answer as a percentage, so perhaps the answer is the coefficient multiplied by 100, or the exponentiated coefficient minus 1.\n\nBut the problem says to use linear regression, which would imply that the model is linear in the log(wage), so the coefficient is the percentage change. However, the exact method depends on how the model is set up. Since the problem says to use the IV method and adjust for other variables, the code should correctly estimate the causal effect.\n\nAssuming that the DoWhy IV method correctly estimates the coefficient, which is the effect of education on log_wage, and the answer.value is that coefficient. Then, the answer should be multiplied by 100 to get the percentage increase. For example, if the coefficient is 0.05, then the answer is 5.00%.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think: if the outcome is log_wage, and the treatment is years_of_schooling, then the effect is the change in log_wage per additional year. So, for each additional year, the log_wage increases by the coefficient. The percentage increase in wage is (exp(coefficient) - 1) * 100. However, if the coefficient is small, this is approximately equal to the coefficient * 100. For example, 0.05 * 100 = 5%, and exp(0.05) -1 \u00e2\u0089\u0088 5.13%. So the answer depends on the exact method.\n\nBut the problem states to use linear regression and IV. So the model is linear in the log_wage. Therefore, the coefficient is the percentage change. So the answer is the coefficient * 100. But I'm not sure. However, the problem says to return the answer as the average additional percentage, so it's better to check the units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model is specified as a linear regression on the original wage, not log_wage. But the data has log_wage as the outcome. So the model is log_wage = \u00ce\u00b2 * education + ... So the coefficient \u00ce\u00b2 is the percentage change in wage. For example, if \u00ce\u00b2 is 0.05, then the log wage increases by 0.05, which corresponds to a 5% increase in wage. Therefore, the answer is 5.00% per year of education.\n\nSo the code should return the answer.value * 100, then round to two decimal places. But the DoWhy code may return the coefficient directly. For example, the Wald estimator (IV method) would give the coefficient. So the answer is the coefficient * 100. Therefore, in the code, the answer is answer.value * 100.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education\". So the answer is the coefficient (in log scale) multiplied by 100. So if the coefficient is 0.05, the answer is 5.00%.\n\nSo the code should return answer.value * 100, then round to two decimal places. Therefore, in the code:\n\nreturn round(answer.value * 100, 2)\n\nBut the problem says \"round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a percent\", which is two decimal places. So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's make sure that the code is correct. The code reads the data, creates the q4_indicator, sets up the model with treatment, outcome, instrument, and common causes. Then estimates the IV effect and returns the value multiplied by 100, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nAnother thing to check: the instrument is the q4_indicator, which is a binary variable. The common causes are year_of_birth and state_of_birth. The treatment is years_of_schooling, and the outcome is log_wage.\n\nSo the code should be correct. However, I should also check if the DoWhy IV method is properly handling the instrument and the common causes. The model.identify_effect() would check if the IV is valid, and the estimate_effect would compute the IV estimator.\n\nTherefore, the final code should be as described.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    import pandas as pd\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('ak91.csv')\n\n    # Create binary indicator for being born in the last quarter (q4)\n    data['q4_indicator'] = (data['quarter_of_birth'] == 4).astype(int)\n\n    # Define treatment, outcome, instrument, and common causes\n    treatment = 'years_of_schooling'\n    outcome = 'log_wage'\n    instruments = 'q4_indicator'\n    common_causes = ['year_of_birth', 'state_of_birth']\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment=treatment,\n        outcome=outcome,\n        instruments=instruments,\n        common_causes=common_causes\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\"\n    )\n    return round(answer.value * 100, 2)\n```"}
