{"role": "user", "content": "You are a data analyst and good at causal reasoning. You are required to respond to a causal question using the \nprovided data. Be prepared for multiple choice and numerical questions. \n\nThe question may be a causal discovery question multiple choice question. \nIn that case, you should reason about the meanings of each variable and use knowledge of the situation to determine the causal relationship. Some variables may not be clearly named, so identify what they mean in the context of the dataset.\nYou may write code to analyze the data, however you should rely on the semantic meaning of the situation primarily and properties of the data secondarily when determining causal relationships. Some questions may have you identify whether variables should be used in \nestimating treatment effects. In that case you can run experiments, and think about tradeoffs.\n\nIf the question is numerical, you should generally follow this methodology:\nThe description and the question can be found below. Please analyze the first 10 rows of the table and write \npython code to analyze the whole table. You should use the DoWhy or causalinference library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation. The steps you should take are: \n1. Identify treatment and effect.\n2. Identify which method to use to estimate the effect, for example outcome modeling, propensity scores, difference in differences, instrumental variables, etc.\n3. Identify which tools to use. For example, for propensity score matching you could use causalinference CausalModel, and for outcome modelling you could use Dowhy CausalModel with backdoor.linear_regression.\n4. Identify variables to adjust for. These could be confounders/common causes, instrumental variables, etc.\n5. Identify how (if necessary) to transform the data. For example, in difference in differences, you would need to separate the data based on time and treatment.\n6. Write code to estimate the effect and return it.\nYou do not have to use dowhy or causalinference. Some of the datasets may be structured such that the treatment effect can be calculated from simple pandas methods, and some might be simpler with other libraries. You have access to Dowhy, causalinference, pandas, scipy, econml, sklearn, and causal-learn. For example, difference in differences does not require any use of dowhy effect estimation.\nThe returned value of the program should be the answer. After the solution function is written, don't write any more code and enter ```. The solution() function MUST be defined. The general format of the code (in an example of outcome modeling with dowhy) should be\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(filename)\n\n    #filter or transform data as necessary\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"treatment_col\"\n        outcome = \"outcome_col\"\n        common_causes = [\"causes\"]\n        instruments = [\"instruments\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=...)\n    return answer.value\n```\n\nData Description:\nTo estimate the effect of cigarette taxation on its consumption, data from cigarette sales were collected and analyzed across 39 states in the United States from the years 1970 to 2000. Proposition 99, a Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act passed in California in 1988, imposed a 25-cent per pack state excise tax on tobacco cigarettes and implemented additional restrictions, including the ban on cigarette vending machines in public areas accessible by juveniles and a ban on the individual sale of single cigarettes. Revenue generated was allocated for environmental and health care programs along with anti-tobacco advertising. We aim to determine if the imposition of this tax and the subsequent regulations led to a reduction in cigarette sales. The data is in the CSV file smoking2.csv.\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nmoking2:\nstate  year     cigsale  ...    retprice  california  after_treatment\n101       4  1978  129.199997  ...   57.400002       False            False\n432      14  1999  101.000000  ...  208.000000       False             True\n309      10  2000  125.500000  ...  260.200012       False             True\n109       4  1986  109.900002  ...   95.099998       False            False\n1001     33  1979  126.400002  ...   62.200001       False            False\n942      31  1982  113.000000  ...   68.000000       False            False\n231       8  1984  103.599998  ...   88.500000       False            False\n49        2  1988  121.500000  ...  119.900002       False            False\n785      26  1980  133.500000  ...   58.700001       False            False\n746      25  1972  103.800003  ...   38.900002       False            False\n\n[10 rows x 9 columns]\n\nQuestion:\nBy the year 2000, what was the estimated reduction in per-capita cigarette sales (in packs) in California as a result of Proposition 99?
