{"role": "user", "content": "You are a data analyst and good at causal reasoning. You are required to respond to a causal question using the \nprovided data. Be prepared for multiple choice and numerical questions. \n\nThe question may be a causal discovery question multiple choice question. \nIn that case, you should reason about the meanings of each variable and use knowledge of the situation to determine the causal relationship. Some variables may not be clearly named, so identify what they mean in the context of the dataset.\nYou may write code to analyze the data, however you should rely on the semantic meaning of the situation primarily and properties of the data secondarily when determining causal relationships. Some questions may have you identify whether variables should be used in \nestimating treatment effects. In that case you can run experiments, and think about tradeoffs.\n\nIf the question is numerical, you should generally follow this methodology:\nThe description and the question can be found below. Please analyze the first 10 rows of the table and write \npython code to analyze the whole table. You should use the DoWhy or causalinference library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation. The steps you should take are: \n1. Identify treatment and effect.\n2. Identify which method to use to estimate the effect, for example outcome modeling, propensity scores, difference in differences, instrumental variables, etc.\n3. Identify which tools to use. For example, for propensity score matching you could use causalinference CausalModel, and for outcome modelling you could use Dowhy CausalModel with backdoor.linear_regression.\n4. Identify variables to adjust for. These could be confounders/common causes, instrumental variables, etc.\n5. Identify how (if necessary) to transform the data. For example, in difference in differences, you would need to separate the data based on time and treatment.\n6. Write code to estimate the effect and return it.\nYou do not have to use dowhy or causalinference. Some of the datasets may be structured such that the treatment effect can be calculated from simple pandas methods, and some might be simpler with other libraries. You have access to Dowhy, causalinference, pandas, scipy, econml, sklearn, and causal-learn. For example, difference in differences does not require any use of dowhy effect estimation.\nThe returned value of the program should be the answer. After the solution function is written, don't write any more code and enter ```. The solution() function MUST be defined. The general format of the code (in an example of outcome modeling with dowhy) should be\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(filename)\n\n    #filter or transform data as necessary\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"treatment_col\"\n        outcome = \"outcome_col\"\n        common_causes = [\"causes\"]\n        instruments = [\"instruments\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=...)\n    return answer.value\n```\n\nData Description:\nThe dataset provided, ak91.csv, contains information on individuals' log wages, years of schooling, year of birth, quarter of birth, and state of birth. The purpose of the analysis is to estimate the effect of education on wage, using linear regression and quarter of birth as an instrumental variable (IV). This idea takes advantage of US compulsory attendance law. Usually, they state that a kid must have turned 6 years by January 1 of the year they enter school. For this reason, kids that are born at the beginning of the year will enter school at an older age. Compulsory attendance law also requires students to be in school until they turn 16, at which point they are legally allowed to drop out. The result is that people born later in the year have, on average, more years of education than those born in the beginning of the year.\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nak91:\nlog_wage  years_of_schooling  ...  quarter_of_birth  state_of_birth\n12663   5.657537                12.0  ...               2.0            37.0\n186092  5.729413                12.0  ...               4.0            26.0\n323078  5.971311                12.0  ...               4.0            26.0\n152372  6.047781                10.0  ...               4.0            17.0\n94610   5.952494                 8.0  ...               4.0            28.0\n124647  5.901214                12.0  ...               4.0            40.0\n255146  5.605873                12.0  ...               4.0            55.0\n93625   6.357876                13.0  ...               4.0            51.0\n80347   5.237107                 8.0  ...               3.0            36.0\n291350  5.818998                11.0  ...               4.0             5.0\n\n[10 rows x 5 columns]\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education based on the instrumental variable of whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4?
