{"role": "user", "content": "You are a data analyst and good at causal reasoning. You are required to respond to a causal question using the \nprovided data. Be prepared for multiple choice and numerical questions. \n\nThe question may be a causal discovery question multiple choice question. \nIn that case, you should reason about the meanings of each variable and use knowledge of the situation to determine the causal relationship. Some variables may not be clearly named, so identify what they mean in the context of the dataset.\nYou may write code to analyze the data, however you should rely on the semantic meaning of the situation primarily and properties of the data secondarily when determining causal relationships. Some questions may have you identify whether variables should be used in \nestimating treatment effects. In that case you can run experiments, and think about tradeoffs.\n\nIf the question is numerical, you should generally follow this methodology:\nThe description and the question can be found below. Please analyze the first 10 rows of the table and write \npython code to analyze the whole table. You should use the DoWhy or causalinference library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation. The steps you should take are: \n1. Identify treatment and effect.\n2. Identify which method to use to estimate the effect, for example outcome modeling, propensity scores, difference in differences, instrumental variables, etc.\n3. Identify which tools to use. For example, for propensity score matching you could use causalinference CausalModel, and for outcome modelling you could use Dowhy CausalModel with backdoor.linear_regression.\n4. Identify variables to adjust for. These could be confounders/common causes, instrumental variables, etc.\n5. Identify how (if necessary) to transform the data. For example, in difference in differences, you would need to separate the data based on time and treatment.\n6. Write code to estimate the effect and return it.\nYou do not have to use dowhy or causalinference. Some of the datasets may be structured such that the treatment effect can be calculated from simple pandas methods, and some might be simpler with other libraries. You have access to Dowhy, causalinference, pandas, scipy, econml, sklearn, and causal-learn. For example, difference in differences does not require any use of dowhy effect estimation.\nThe returned value of the program should be the answer. After the solution function is written, don't write any more code and enter ```. The solution() function MUST be defined. The general format of the code (in an example of outcome modeling with dowhy) should be\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(filename)\n\n    #filter or transform data as necessary\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"treatment_col\"\n        outcome = \"outcome_col\"\n        common_causes = [\"causes\"]\n        instruments = [\"instruments\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=...)\n    return answer.value\n```\n\nData Description:\nThe dataset billboard_impact.csv details information from a quasi-experiment assessing the influence of billboards on bank deposits in two cities: Porto Alegre (treatment group) and Florianopolis (control group). The csv file contains records with three variables: deposits (average bank deposits in Brazilian Reais), poa (A dummy indicator for the city of Porto Alegre. When it is zero, it means the samples are from Florianopolis.), and jul (A dummy for the month of July, or for the post intervention period. When it is zero it refers to samples from May, the pre-intervention period).\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nbillboard_impact:\ndeposits  poa  jul\n3683       161    0    1\n4411       196    0    1\n2584       185    0    0\n69           0    1    0\n1844       281    0    0\n33          89    1    0\n3085       176    0    1\n4034       232    0    1\n4469       273    0    1\n4578       298    0    1\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the average increase in bank deposits per customer in Porto Alegre after the billboard intervention? Please round the final answer to the nearest hundredth."}
