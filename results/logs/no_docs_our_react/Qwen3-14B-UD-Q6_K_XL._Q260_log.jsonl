{"role": "user", "content": "You are a data analyst and good at causal reasoning. You are required to respond to a causal question using the \nprovided data. Be prepared for multiple choice and numerical questions. \n\nThe question may be a causal discovery question multiple choice question. \nIn that case, you should reason about the meanings of each variable and use knowledge of the situation to determine the causal relationship. Some variables may not be clearly named, so identify what they mean in the context of the dataset.\nYou may write code to analyze the data, however you should rely on the semantic meaning of the situation primarily and properties of the data secondarily when determining causal relationships. Some questions may have you identify whether variables should be used in \nestimating treatment effects. In that case you can run experiments, and think about tradeoffs.\n\nIf the question is numerical, you should generally follow this methodology:\nThe description and the question can be found below. Please analyze the first 10 rows of the table and write \npython code to analyze the whole table. You should use the DoWhy or causalinference library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation. The steps you should take are: \n1. Identify treatment and effect.\n2. Identify which method to use to estimate the effect, for example outcome modeling, propensity scores, difference in differences, instrumental variables, etc.\n3. Identify which tools to use. For example, for propensity score matching you could use causalinference CausalModel, and for outcome modelling you could use Dowhy CausalModel with backdoor.linear_regression.\n4. Identify variables to adjust for. These could be confounders/common causes, instrumental variables, etc.\n5. Identify how (if necessary) to transform the data. For example, in difference in differences, you would need to separate the data based on time and treatment.\n6. Write code to estimate the effect and return it.\nYou do not have to use dowhy or causalinference. Some of the datasets may be structured such that the treatment effect can be calculated from simple pandas methods, and some might be simpler with other libraries. You have access to Dowhy, causalinference, pandas, scipy, econml, sklearn, and causal-learn. For example, difference in differences does not require any use of dowhy effect estimation.\nThe returned value of the program should be the answer. After the solution function is written, don't write any more code and enter ```. The solution() function MUST be defined. The general format of the code (in an example of outcome modeling with dowhy) should be\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(filename)\n\n    #filter or transform data as necessary\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"treatment_col\"\n        outcome = \"outcome_col\"\n        common_causes = [\"causes\"]\n        instruments = [\"instruments\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=...)\n    return answer.value\n```\n\nData Description:\nTo find the effect of price on ice cream sales, the dataset ice_cream_sales.csv is used for training, and ice_cream_sales_rnd.csv is used for testing. Our test set has randomly assigned prices but our training data has only observational prices, which is potentially biased. Each unit is a day. For each day, we know which day of a week it is, what was the cost we had to make the ice cream (you can think of the cost as a proxy for quality) and the average temperature for that day. Then, we have our treatment, price, and our outcome, the number of ice cream sold.\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nice_cream_sale:\ntemp  weekday  cost  price  sales\n6252  21.2        1   1.0    7.3    213\n4684  27.2        5   1.0    5.9    214\n1731  22.5        2   0.5    4.3    188\n4742  23.1        6   1.0    5.6    197\n4521  21.6        7   0.3    8.2    204\n6340  28.7        1   1.0    7.3    222\n576   25.0        2   1.5    6.8    203\n5202  18.8        2   1.5    7.5    187\n6363  22.3        7   0.3    5.4    247\n439   25.5        3   1.0    6.3    193\nice_cream_sales_rnd:\ntemp  weekday  cost  price  sales\n1501  21.4        1   0.5      7    230\n2586  22.9        5   0.3      7    185\n2653  25.1        6   0.5      9    194\n1055  22.9        5   1.5      3    208\n705   22.6        7   1.0     10    175\n106   20.6        7   1.5      3    256\n589   25.1        7   0.3      5    245\n2468  19.7        4   1.0      9    183\n2413  24.9        1   0.5      5    248\n1600  14.2        5   1.0      7    162\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the estimated average treatment effect (ATE) of the ice cream price on sales, rounded to two decimal places?"}
