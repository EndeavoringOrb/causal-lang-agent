Each customer was randomly assigned to either receive an email about negotiating their debt or to be part of a control group that did not receive the email. Data was collected on the amounts paid by the late customers after this intervention. The dataset collections_email.csv contains variables including the amount paid (`payments`), whether the email was sent (`email`), whether the email was opened (`opened`), whether the customer contacted the collections department to negotiate their debt after having received the email (`agreement`), the customer's credit limit before being late (`credit_limit`), and the customer's risk score prior to the delivery of the email (`risk_score`).\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nollections_email:\npayments  email  opened  agreement  credit_limit  risk_score\n1501       680      1     0.0        0.0    894.098456    0.420862\n2586       710      0     0.0        0.0   1767.356294    0.602713\n2653       630      0     0.0        0.0   1109.376062    0.486760\n1055       640      1     1.0        1.0   1423.371900    0.547806\n705        620      0     0.0        0.0   1236.673224    0.510474\n106        570      0     0.0        0.0    618.787066    0.351253\n589        650      0     0.0        0.0   1229.565395    0.507863\n2468       730      1     0.0        0.0   1322.810285    0.525914\n2413       770      0     0.0        0.0   1753.129045    0.584226\n1600       750      0     0.0        0.0   1702.889996    0.589740\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average treatment effect (ATE) on payments from sending the email reminder to late-paying customers?

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to find the average treatment effect (ATE) of sending an email reminder on payments. The dataset includes variables like payments, email (treatment), opened, agreement, credit_limit, and risk_score.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the treatment, outcome, common causes, instruments, and effect modifiers. The treatment is 'email' since that's the intervention. The outcome is 'payments' as that's what we're measuring. Common causes are variables that affect both treatment and outcome. From the data description, the customers were randomly assigned to the email group or control, so maybe 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score' are pre-treatment variables that could influence both the treatment assignment and the payments. Wait, but the email was randomly assigned, so maybe there are no common causes? Wait, no. Wait, the random assignment implies that the treatment is randomized, so there shouldn't be confounding variables. But the question says to adjust for variables, so maybe they want us to include some variables as common causes. Let me check the data again.\n\nThe data has 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score' as pre-treatment variables. Since the treatment was randomly assigned, those variables might not be confounders, but perhaps they are effect modifiers. However, the question says to adjust for variables, so maybe they should be included as common causes. Wait, but if the treatment was randomly assigned, there's no need to adjust for them. However, maybe the question expects us to include them as common causes. Hmm, but the user's instruction says to \"choose the variables to adjust for\". Let me think again.\n\nIn the data description, the email was randomly assigned, so ideally, there should be no confounding variables. However, perhaps the variables like 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score' are baseline characteristics that could influence payments. But since the treatment was random, they might not affect the treatment assignment. But in practice, even with randomization, we might adjust for them to get more precise estimates. So for the causal model, the common causes would be 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score'. Instruments might not be needed here since the treatment is random. Effect modifiers could be variables that affect the treatment effect, like 'opened' or 'agreement', but the question says to conduct linear regression, so maybe those are not needed. Wait, the user says to choose variables to adjust for, so perhaps 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score' should be included as common causes. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Identify treatment (email), outcome (payments). Common causes are credit_limit and risk_score. Since the treatment is random, there's no need for instruments. Effect modifiers could be variables that modify the treatment effect, but since the question says to do linear regression, perhaps we don't need them. \n\nSo the CausalModel would have treatment='email', outcome='payments', common_causes=['credit_limit', 'risk_score'].\n\nThen, using DoWhy, we need to identify the effect and estimate it using linear regression. The method_name for estimation would be 'backdoor.linear_regression'.\n\nWait, the user says to conduct linear regression. The DoWhy's backdoor.linear_regression is a method that uses linear regression to estimate the effect. So the code would use that method.\n\nNow, the code structure would be:\n\nRead the data, create the model with treatment, outcome, common causes. Then identify effect, then estimate using linear regression. Return the value.\n\nBut wait, the user says to adjust for variables, which are the common causes. So including those in common_causes is correct.\n\nNow, checking the first 10 rows of the data. The email column is 0 or 1. Payments are the amounts. The other variables are credit_limit and risk_score. So the model would be:\n\nmodel = CausalModel(\n    data=data,\n    treatment='email',\n    outcome='payments',\n    common_causes=['credit_limit', 'risk_score']\n)\n\nThen identify effect, then estimate with method_name='backdoor.linear_regression'.\n\nBut the DoWhy documentation says that for the 'backdoor.linear_regression' method, the common causes are already accounted for. So the code should work.\n\nNow, the answer would be the ATE estimated by the model. The user says to round to the nearest hundredth.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('collections_email.csv')\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment='email',\n        outcome='payments',\n        common_causes=['credit_limit', 'risk_score']\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name='backdoor.linear_regression'\n    )\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n\nWait, but the user says to use the DoWhy library, and the code must be written accordingly. Also, the first 10 rows are provided, but the code should process the entire dataset.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says that the first 10 rows are given, but the code should process the entire table. The code reads the entire CSV.\n\nSo that's the plan. However, need to make sure that the variables are correctly set. Also, check if the 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score' are the correct common causes.\n\nWait, the question says that the email was randomly assigned. So in theory, there should be no confounding variables, so the ATE can be estimated by just taking the difference in means between the treatment and control groups. But the user wants to adjust for variables, so perhaps they are suggesting to include 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score' as common causes. \n\nBut the question says to \"choose the variables to adjust for\". So maybe the correct approach is to include all variables except the treatment and outcome as common causes. Wait, but that's not correct. The common causes are variables that affect both treatment and outcome. Since the treatment is randomly assigned, there should be no confounding variables. But perhaps the question is expecting us to adjust for 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score' as they are baseline variables that may influence the outcome.\n\nBut in the absence of any confounding variables, the ATE would be the difference in mean payments between the two groups. However, the user says to adjust for variables, which suggests that they want to include them in the model. So including them as common causes would allow the linear regression to adjust for them.\n\nBut since the treatment was randomized, including them may not be necessary, but the problem says to adjust for variables. So the code should proceed as described.\n\nAnother thing to check: the 'opened' and 'agreement' variables. Are they effect modifiers? For example, maybe the effect of the email depends on whether the email was opened. But the user says to conduct linear regression, which might not account for effect modifiers unless specified. However, the problem says to \"choose the variables to adjust for\", so perhaps they are not needed here.\n\nSo the final code should be as outlined.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('collections_email.csv')\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment='email',\n        outcome='payments',\n        common_causes=['credit_limit', 'risk_score']\n    )\n\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name='backdoor.linear_regression'\n    )\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n```"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the average treatment effect (ATE) of sending an email reminder on payments, using linear regression. They provided the first 10 rows of the dataset and mentioned variables like email, payments, credit_limit, and risk_score.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how DoWhy works. The CausalModel requires specifying treatment, outcome, and common causes. The common causes here are variables that affect both treatment and outcome. From the data description, the email was randomly assigned, so maybe credit_limit and risk_score are confounders. Wait, but if the email was randomly assigned, then those variables might not be confounders. Hmm, but the question says to adjust for variables, so maybe the user wants to include credit_limit and risk_score as common causes.\n\nThe user's code used common_causes=['credit_limit', 'risk_score'], which makes sense if they are confounders. The model then uses backdoor.linear_regression. The output was 4.43, but there's a warning about Series.__getitem__.\n\nWait, the warning is about using integer keys as positions. But the code seems correct. Maybe the problem is that the DoWhy model is using a different method. Let me check the code again.\n\nThe code reads the CSV, creates the model with treatment 'email', outcome 'payments', and common causes as credit_limit and risk_score. Then identifies the effect and estimates using linear regression. The answer is rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe output is 4.43. But the warning is from pandas, not the DoWhy code. So maybe the code is correct, but the warning is just a notice. The user wants the answer rounded to the nearest hundredth, which 4.43 already is. So the code is correct. But maybe the actual answer is different? Or perhaps the model is not properly adjusted.\n\nWait, maybe the treatment is binary (email is 0 or 1), and the outcome is payments. The linear regression would estimate the difference in means between the treatment and control groups, adjusting for credit_limit and risk_score. The ATE would be the coefficient of the email variable in the regression model.\n\nBut in the code, the model is using the DoWhy library's linear regression method. The warning might be a red herring. The answer provided by the code is 4.43, which is correct given the data.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is trying to calculate the average treatment effect (ATE) of sending an email reminder on payments using the DoWhy library. The previous code they wrote resulted in a warning about Series.__getitem__ treating keys as positions. The output was 4.43, which they might be satisfied with, but the warning is a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why that warning is happening. The error message says that in a future version, integer keys will be treated as labels, not positions. So, maybe in their code, they're using integer keys in a way that's causing this. However, looking at their code, they're using 'email' as the treatment and 'payments' as the outcome. The common causes are 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score'. \n\nWait, the warning might be coming from somewhere else in the DoWhy library or the pandas version they're using. The code they wrote seems correct. The model is set up with the right treatment and outcome variables, and the common causes are the ones that are likely confounders. The estimate_effect method is using linear regression, which is appropriate for a continuous outcome like payments.\n\nBut the warning is about Series.__getitem__, which is a pandas method. Maybe the code is using an older version of pandas where this warning isn't raised, but in a newer version, it's deprecated. However, the user's code is correct, and the warning might not affect the result. The answer they got is 4.43, which is rounded to two decimal places as required.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the code isn't handling the data correctly. Let me check the data again. The first 10 rows show that 'email' is a binary variable (0 or 1), 'payments' is the amount paid, and the other variables are credit limit and risk score. The common causes are correctly specified as credit_limit and risk_score because they are likely to influence both the treatment (email) and the outcome (payments). \n\nWait, but in the setup of the CausalModel, the common_causes are the variables that are confounders. However, in this case, the email is randomly assigned, so perhaps there are no confounders. But the problem states that the study was a random test, so the email assignment is random. Therefore, in theory, there should be no confounding, and the ATE can be estimated without adjusting for any variables. However, the user's code includes credit_limit and risk_score as common causes. \n\nWait, this might be a mistake. If the email was randomly assigned, then credit_limit and risk_score shouldn't be confounders. Because random assignment implies that the treatment is independent of all other variables. However, maybe the user is following the problem's instruction to adjust for variables, even if they are not necessary. The problem says to \"choose the variables to adjust for, conduct linear regression\". But in reality, if the treatment is random, adjusting for other variables isn't necessary. However, the problem might be expecting the user to adjust for those variables as per the data description. \n\nBut the warning is unrelated to that. The warning is about how pandas handles integer keys. The user's code is correct, but maybe in their environment, the version of pandas is causing this warning. However, the code should still run correctly. The answer of 4.43 seems plausible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the treatment variable is not properly formatted. The 'email' column has values 0 and 1, which is correct for a binary treatment. The outcome is 'payments', which is continuous.

We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Regression\nUse linear regression.\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nMethod 3: Propensity Score Stratification\nWe will be using propensity scores to stratify units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_strat = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_stratification\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\")\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\nAlternatively, Causalinference has a simple way to train bias adjusted matching estimators:\nfrom causalinference import CausalModel\n\ncm = CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"recovery\"].values, \n    D=med[\"medication\"].values, \n    X=med[[\"severity\", \"age\", \"sex\"]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nprint(cm.estimates)\n\nMethod 5: Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\nData Description:\nIn a study to determine the causal effect of sending an email reminder on the repayment of debts, a fintech company conducted a random test involving 5000 customers who were late on their payments. Each customer was randomly assigned to either receive an email about negotiating their debt or to be part of a control group that did not receive the email. Data was collected on the amounts paid by the late customers after this intervention. The dataset collections_email.csv contains variables including the amount paid (`payments`), whether the email was sent (`email`), whether the email was opened (`opened`), whether the customer contacted the collections department to negotiate their debt after having received the email (`agreement`), the customer's credit limit before being late (`credit_limit`), and the customer's risk score prior to the delivery of the email (`risk_score`).\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nollections_email:\npayments  email  opened  agreement  credit_limit  risk_score\n1501       680      1     0.0        0.0    894.098456    0.420862\n2586       710      0     0.0        0.0   1767.356294    0.602713\n2653       630      0     0.0        0.0   1109.376062    0.486760\n1055       640      1     1.0        1.0   1423.371900    0.547806\n705        620      0     0.0        0.0   1236.673224    0.510474\n106        570      0     0.0        0.0    618.787066    0.351253\n589        650      0     0.0        0.0   1229.565395    0.507863\n2468       730      1     0.0        0.0   1322.810285    0.525914\n2413       770      0     0.0        0.0   1753.129045    0.584226\n1600       750      0     0.0        0.0   1702.889996    0.589740\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average treatment effect (ATE) on payments from sending the email reminder to late-paying customers?

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to find the average treatment effect (ATE) of sending an email reminder on payments. The dataset has variables like payments, email (treatment), opened, agreement, credit_limit, and risk_score.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the treatment and outcome. The treatment is whether the email was sent (email column), and the outcome is the payments. The question mentions adjusting for variables, so I should figure out which ones are confounders. From the data description, credit_limit and risk_score are likely confounders since they might influence both the treatment assignment and the payments. The opened and agreement variables might be intermediate variables, but the problem says to adjust for confounders, so maybe credit_limit and risk_score are the ones to include.\n\nNext, using DoWhy, I'll build the causal model. The steps are: identify treatment and outcome, specify common causes (confounders), then estimate the effect using linear regression. The method_name should be \"backdoor.linear_regression\". \n\nWait, the data is already structured with the treatment (email) and outcome (payments). The common causes are credit_limit and risk_score. So in the CausalModel, I'll set treatment='email', outcome='payments', common_causes=['credit_limit', 'risk_score']. Then, identify the effect and estimate using linear regression. \n\nI should also check if there's any need for transforming data, but the problem says to use linear regression, so maybe not. The code will read the CSV, set up the model, identify the effect, and estimate it. Then return the value rounded to two decimal places.\n\nWait, the first 10 rows show that email is 1 or 0. So the treatment is binary. The outcome is payments, which is continuous. So linear regression is appropriate here. The common causes are credit_limit and risk_score. \n\nI need to make sure that the code correctly loads the data, sets the treatment and outcome, includes the common causes, and then uses the backdoor.linear_regression method. Also, the answer should be rounded to the nearest hundredth. \n\nLet me structure the code: read the data, create the model with the specified parameters, identify the effect, estimate using linear regression, and return the value. Let me check the DoWhy example code again. The example uses method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\". So that's the correct method here. \n\nI think that's it. The code should look like the example provided, with the correct parameters.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a dataset about email reminders and debt repayment. The question is to find the average treatment effect (ATE) of sending the email on payments.

The output is rounded to two decimal places. So the answer should be 4.43. The user's code seems correct, and the warning might not affect the result. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('collections_email.csv')\n\n    # Identify treatment and outcome\n    treatment = \"email\"\n    outcome = \"payments\"\n    common_causes = [\"credit_limit\", \"risk_score\"]\n\n    # Build causal model\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment=treatment,\n        outcome=outcome,\n        common_causes=common_causes\n    )\n\n    # Identify the causal effect\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\n    # Estimate the effect using linear regression\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\"\n    )\n\n    # Return the value rounded to the nearest hundredth\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n```"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is using the DoWhy library to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of sending an email reminder on payments. They provided the code, and the output is 4.43, but there's a deprecation warning about Series.__getitem__.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the warning is happening. The error message says that using integer keys as positions is deprecated. That probably means somewhere in the code, they're accessing a Series with an integer key, which in future versions will be treated as a label instead of a position. But the code they provided doesn't have any obvious issues with that. Maybe the DoWhy library internally uses some operations that trigger this warning.\n\nWait, the user's code uses `answer.value` to get the ATE. The `estimate_effect` method returns a `CausalEstimate` object, which has a `value` attribute. But if the `value` is a pandas Series, accessing it with an integer might cause the warning. However, in the code, they're just accessing `answer.value`, which might be a single value. Wait, no\u00e2\u0080\u0094if the treatment is binary (email is 0 or 1), the ATE is the difference in means, so `answer.value` should be a single number. But maybe in some cases, it's a Series, and when they round it, it's trying to access an integer key.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the deprecation warning is from a different part of the code. The user's code seems correct. The main thing is that the answer is 4.43, which is the ATE. The warning might be a red herring, or maybe it's a known issue with DoWhy. Since the user's answer is correct, maybe the warning can be ignored for now. The user just needs to make sure that the code is correct and that the answer is properly rounded.\n\nWait, the user's code is correct. They identified the treatment as \"email\", outcome as \"payments\", and adjusted for \"credit_limit\" and \"risk_score\". The linear regression method is appropriate here. The output is 4.43, which is the ATE. The warning is about a deprecated feature, but it's not affecting the correctness of the answer. So the code is correct, and the answer is 4.43.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('collections_email.csv')\n\n    # Identify treatment and outcome\n    treatment = \"email\"\n    outcome = \"payments\"\n    common_causes = [\"credit_limit\", \"risk_score\"]\n\n    # Build causal model\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment=treatment,\n        outcome=outcome,\n        common_causes=common_causes\n    )\n\n    # Identify the causal effect\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\n    # Estimate the effect using linear regression\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\"\n    )\n\n    # Return the value rounded to the nearest hundredth\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n```"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is getting a deprecation warning about Series.__getitem__ treating keys as positions. Hmm, that's from pandas, right? The warning says that in a future version, integer keys will be treated as labels, not positions. So they need to use .iloc[] for position-based access.\n\nBut wait, the code they're using is from the solution function, which is supposed to return the average treatment effect (ATE) using DoWhy's linear regression method. The output is 4.43, which is correct, but the warning is about a deprecated feature. However, the warning doesn't seem to be directly related to the DoWhy code. Maybe the warning is coming from somewhere else in the code or from pandas operations that are happening internally.\n\nLooking at their code, they're using DoWhy's CausalModel with common causes as credit_limit and risk_score. The treatment is 'email' (binary, 0 or 1), and outcome is 'payments'. The model is set up correctly. The estimate_effect is using backdoor.linear_regression. The answer is being rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe warning message is about Series.__getitem__ and integer keys. That might be happening when DoWhy or pandas is accessing data internally. But since the code is correct and the answer is 4.43, which matches the expected output, maybe the warning is just a side effect and not an error. The user might not need to address it unless it's causing a crash. However, the user is asking for the code to be correct and to return the answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the warning is due to how the data is being processed. Let me check the data structure. The first 10 rows show that 'email' is 0 or 1, 'payments' is the amount paid, and other variables like 'credit_limit' and 'risk_score' are numerical. The code is using those as common causes. The linear regression method in DoWhy should adjust for those variables. The result is 4.43, which seems plausible.\n\nBut the user is getting the warning. To suppress the warning, maybe they can update pandas or adjust their code. However, the problem statement says that the solution function should return the answer, and the code is correct. The warning might not affect the correctness of the result. So the code as written is correct, and the answer is 4.43. The user's previous attempts have the same code, and the output is correct. Therefore, the answer is 4.43, and the code is correct, even with the warning.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv('collections_email.csv')\n\n    # Identify treatment and outcome\n    treatment = \"email\"\n    outcome = \"payments\"\n    common_causes = [\"credit_limit\", \"risk_score\"]\n\n    # Build causal model\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment=treatment,\n        outcome=outcome,\n        common_causes=common_causes\n    )\n\n    # Identify the causal effect\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\n    # Estimate the effect using linear regression\n    answer = model.estimate_effect(\n        identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\"\n    )\n\n    # Return the value rounded to the nearest hundredth\n    return round(answer.value, 2)\n```"}
