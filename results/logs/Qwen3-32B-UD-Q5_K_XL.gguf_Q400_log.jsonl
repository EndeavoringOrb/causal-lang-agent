We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Regression\nUse linear regression.\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nMethod 3: Propensity Score Stratification\nWe will be using propensity scores to stratify units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_strat = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_stratification\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\")\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\nAlternatively, Causalinference has a simple way to train bias adjusted matching estimators:\nfrom causalinference import CausalModel\n\ncm = CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"recovery\"].values, \n    D=med[\"medication\"].values, \n    X=med[[\"severity\", \"age\", \"sex\"]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nprint(cm.estimates)\n\nMethod 5: Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\nData Description:\nThree social scientists conducted an RCT in which they investigated whether social pressure within neighborhoods increases participation. Specifically, during a primary election in the state of Michigan, they randomly assigned registered voters to receive different get-out-the-vote (GOTV) messages and examined whether sending postcards with these messages increased turnout. The researchers exploited the fact that the turnout of individual voters is public information in the United States. The GOTV message of particular interest was designed to induce social pressure by telling voters that after the election their neighbors would be informed about whether they voted in the election or not. The researchers hypothesized that such a namingand-shaming GOTV strategy would increase participation.\nThere are three treatment groups: voters who receive either the social pressure message, the civic duty message, or the Hawthorne effect message. The Hawthorne effect refers to the phenomenon where study subjects behave differently because they know they are being observed by researchers. The experiment also has a control group which consists of those voters receiving no message. The researchers randomly assigned each voter to one of the four groups and examined whether the voter turnout was different across the groups.\n\nThe data is in the file social.csv.\nVariable Description\nhhsize: household size of the voter\nmessages: GOTV messages the voter received (Civic Duty, Control, Neighbors, Hawthorne)\nsex: sex of the voter (female or male)\nyearofbirth: year of birth of the voter\nprimary2004: whether the voter voted in the 2004 primary election (1=voted, 0=abstained)\nprimary2006: whether the voter turned out in the 2006 primary election (1=voted, 0=abstained)\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nocial:\nsex  yearofbirth  primary2004   messages  primary2006  hhsize\n252297  female         1965            0  Hawthorne            0       2\n183316  female         1953            1    Control            1       3\n13563   female         1964            0  Neighbors            1       2\n278587  female         1946            0    Control            1       3\n197879    male         1983            0  Hawthorne            0       4\n55645     male         1982            0  Neighbors            0       2\n101222  female         1944            1    Control            1       3\n121632  female         1962            1    Control            0       1\n283529    male         1977            1    Control            0       3\n163263    male         1956            0    Control            1       2\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average causal effect of the Neighbors message on whether the voter voted in the 2006 primary election if the voter's age was 25 in 2006? Please estimate a linear regression model with both message and age as predictors, and round the result to the nearest thousandth."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the average causal effect of the Neighbors message on voter turnout in the 2006 primary election for voters who were 25 years old in 2006. They want a linear regression model with both message and age as predictors, and the result rounded to the nearest thousandth.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the data. The dataset has variables like messages (with categories like Neighbors, Control, etc.), primary2006 (the outcome variable indicating if they voted), and other demographics. The target is voters aged 25 in 2006. Since age is based on the year of birth, I need to calculate that. For 2006, age would be 2006 minus yearofbirth. So a voter who is 25 in 2006 would have a yearofbirth of 2006 - 25 = 1981. Wait, but looking at the first 10 rows, there's a male born in 1983. That would make him 23 in 2006. Hmm. So I need to filter the data where 2006 - yearofbirth equals 25, which means yearofbirth is 1981. So filter the data to include only those with yearofbirth == 1981.\n\nNext, the treatment is the 'Neighbors' message. The outcome is primary2006. The other variables like hhsize, sex, primary2004 might be confounders, but the problem says to use a linear regression model with both message and age as predictors. Wait, age here is calculated as 2006 - yearofbirth. But since we are already filtering to age 25, including age in the model might not vary. Wait, that's a problem. Because if we filter to only those who are 25 in 2006, then age is fixed at 25. Including age as a predictor in the regression would make it a constant, leading to perfect multicollinearity if we also include the intercept. Wait, but the problem says to estimate a linear regression model with both message and age as predictors. But if age is fixed, then how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the model to include age as a variable, but when we filter for age=25, age becomes a constant. That would cause the coefficient for age to be zero, but since it's a constant, the model might not be able to estimate it properly. That's a problem. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the question.\n\nThe question says \"if the voter's age was 25 in 2006\". So we are looking at voters who were exactly 25 in 2006. So age is fixed at 25. But the problem says to include age as a predictor. However, when age is fixed, including it in the regression would not contribute anything, as it's a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have age as part of the model even though it's fixed. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased in a way that age is a variable in the model, but we are conditioning on age=25. Let me think.\n\nIn linear regression, if we include age as a variable, but we are restricting the data to age=25, then the coefficient for age would be zero, but the model would still fit the other variables. However, the coefficient for the message (Neighbors vs. Control) would still be estimable. Because the other variables (messages) vary. So in this case, the coefficient for the Neighbors message would represent the effect of receiving that message on primary2006, given that age is fixed at 25.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\n1. Filter the data to include only rows where (2006 - yearofbirth) == 25. That is, yearofbirth = 2006 -25 = 1981. So filter yearofbirth == 1981.\n\n2. Then, perform a linear regression with primary2006 as the outcome, and messages (categorical variable, with Neighbors vs others) and age as predictors. Wait, but age here is fixed at 25. So in the model, age is a constant. Including it in the regression would not affect the coefficient for the treatment (Neighbors), but the model would still run. However, the coefficient for age would be zero, but the model may include it as a variable. However, since age is fixed, it's a constant, and the coefficient for age can't be estimated meaningfully. But the problem says to include age as a predictor. So perhaps the problem expects us to include age in the model even though it's fixed. Let's proceed.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the problem is not asking to filter the data to only include age=25, but to include age as a variable in the regression model, and then the effect of the message is adjusted for age. However, the question says \"if the voter's age was 25 in 2006\". So maybe the model is to adjust for age, and then the effect is the average causal effect for age=25. But that's a bit different. For example, in that case, we would not filter the data to only age=25, but instead include age as a variable in the model, and the coefficient for the treatment would represent the effect of the treatment at the mean age or adjusted for age. However, the question says \"if the voter's age was 25 in 2006\", which might imply a conditional effect. But the wording is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the problem says to estimate a linear regression model with both message and age as predictors, I think the correct approach is to include age as a variable in the model, not to filter the data to only age=25. Wait, but the question says \"if the voter's age was 25 in 2006\". So perhaps we need to condition on age=25, which would mean filtering the data to those voters. But that would make age a constant in the model. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe question is: \"What is the average causal effect of the Neighbors message on whether the voter voted in the 2006 primary election if the voter's age was 25 in 2006?\"\n\nThis phrasing suggests that we're looking at the effect of the message on voters who were 25. So the data should be filtered to include only those voters. Then, the regression would be run on that subset. However, in that case, age is fixed at 25, so including it in the model would not contribute anything. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have age as a variable in the model, but not to filter the data. But that contradicts the \"if the voter's age was 25\" part. Maybe there's confusion here. Let me try to think of both possibilities.\n\nPossibility 1: Filter to age=25, then run regression with message and age (which is fixed, so the coefficient for age is zero, but the message effect is estimated).\n\nPossibility 2: Do not filter, but include age as a covariate in the regression, and the effect is adjusted for age. The question says \"if the voter's age was 25\", which could be interpreted as the effect adjusted for age, evaluated at age 25. However, the problem says \"estimate a linear regression model with both message and age as predictors\". So the model would be:\n\nprimary2006 = beta0 + beta1*(Neighbors) + beta2*age + ... \n\nWhere Neighbors is a dummy variable indicating if the message was Neighbors. The other messages (Civic Duty, Hawthorne) would need to be encoded as dummy variables as well. However, the problem says \"the average causal effect of the Neighbors message\", so perhaps the model is comparing Neighbors vs. Control, since the control group is the baseline. But the messages variable has four categories: Civic Duty, Control, Neighbors, Hawthorne. So in the regression, the treatment variable is a categorical variable with four levels, and we need to compare each treatment against the control. However, the question specifically asks about the effect of the Neighbors message. So in the regression, we would set Control as the reference category, and the coefficient for Neighbors would represent the effect of receiving the Neighbors message compared to the Control.\n\nBut the problem says to estimate a linear regression model with both message and age as predictors. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Create dummy variables for the messages. Since there are four categories, we'll have three dummy variables (assuming one is the reference). For example, if Control is the reference, then we have dummies for Civic Duty, Neighbors, and Hawthorne.\n\n2. Include age as a continuous variable.\n\n3. Fit the linear regression model.\n\n4. The coefficient for the Neighbors dummy variable is the average causal effect of the Neighbors message compared to the Control, adjusted for age.\n\nBut the question says \"if the voter's age was 25 in 2006\". So perhaps the model should be evaluated at age 25. However, in linear regression, the coefficient for the treatment (Neighbors) is the effect at the mean age, or adjusted for age. So if the coefficient is, say, 0.15, that would mean that, on average, the Neighbors message increases the probability of voting by 15 percentage points, holding age constant. Therefore, the answer would be the coefficient for the Neighbors message in the regression model that includes age as a covariate.\n\nWait, but the problem says to estimate the model with both message and age as predictors, and the question is about the average causal effect when age is 25. But the coefficient for the message is the average effect across all ages, adjusted for age. So the effect at age 25 would be the same as the coefficient, because the effect is adjusted for age. So perhaps the problem's mention of age being 25 is just to indicate that age should be included in the model as a covariate, not to filter the data. But that's a bit confusing. However, given that the problem says to include both message and age as predictors, and the question is about the effect of the message when age is 25, the correct approach is to include age as a covariate in the regression model, without filtering the data. The effect is the coefficient for the Neighbors message compared to the Control.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python. The data is in 'social.csv'. The variables are messages, primary2006, yearofbirth. We need to calculate age in 2006 as 2006 - yearofbirth. Then, create dummy variables for the messages, including the Neighbors message. Then fit a linear regression model with primary2006 as the dependent variable, and the dummies for messages (with Control as reference) and age as predictors. The coefficient for the Neighbors dummy variable is the average causal effect we need.\n\nBut the problem says \"if the voter's age was 25 in 2006\". So perhaps the model is run on all data, but the effect is evaluated at age 25. However, in linear regression, the coefficient for the treatment is the same regardless of the value of age, because it's adjusted for age. So the effect is the same for any age. So the answer would just be the coefficient of the Neighbors message in the model.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n1. Load the data.\n\n2. Calculate age_in_2006 = 2006 - yearofbirth.\n\n3. Create dummy variables for messages. Since there are four categories, we need to create three dummy variables (e.g., Civic Duty, Hawthorne, Neighbors, with Control as the baseline).\n\n4. Fit a linear regression model where primary2006 is regressed on the dummies for messages and age_in_2006.\n\n5. The coefficient for the Neighbors dummy variable is the desired effect.\n\nNow, in the problem statement, it says to use DoWhy. However, since the problem can be solved using simple pandas and sklearn, perhaps using DoWhy is not necessary. However, the user has instructed to use DoWhy if possible.\n\nBut according to the problem's example, using a simple linear regression model can be done with DoWhy's backdoor.linear_regression method. So let's proceed with that.\n\nThe treatment variable is whether the message is Neighbors. However, since there are four treatment groups (Control, Civic Duty, Neighbors, Hawthorne), we need to set up the treatment as a categorical variable. However, in DoWhy's CausalModel, the treatment is a single variable. Wait, but in this case, the treatment is the messages variable, which is categorical. The problem asks for the effect of the Neighbors message compared to the Control. So perhaps we can create a binary treatment variable indicating whether the message is Neighbors (1) or not (0, which includes Control, Civic Duty, and Hawthorne). However, this would ignore the other treatments. Alternatively, perhaps the model should compare each treatment against the Control. But since the question is specifically about the Neighbors message, maybe we can set the treatment to be a binary variable (Neighbors vs others) and use the other variables as confounders. However, the problem says to include both message and age as predictors, which suggests that the model should adjust for the other messages. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to treat messages as a categorical variable with four levels, and then use DoWhy to model the effect of one treatment (Neighbors) compared to the Control. However, DoWhy's CausalModel requires specifying a single treatment variable. So perhaps we can create a binary treatment variable (Neighbors vs. non-Neighbors) and then include the other message types as confounders. Alternatively, use a regression approach where the treatment is a dummy variable for Neighbors, and other message types (Civic Duty, Hawthorne) are included as confounders.\n\nBut the problem says to estimate a linear regression model with both message and age as predictors. So the messages variable is a categorical variable with four levels, and we need to create dummy variables for it. Let me think. For example, using pandas' get_dummies, we can create dummies for messages, drop one (Control) as the reference. Then, include those dummies and age in the regression.\n\nBut using DoWhy for this case may not be straightforward. Let me check the DoWhy documentation. The CausalModel in DoWhy can handle multiple treatments? Or perhaps the treatment is a single variable. Let me see. In the examples provided earlier, the treatment is a single variable, like \"treatment_col\". So in this case, the treatment is the message received, which is a categorical variable. However, the user wants to compare the Neighbors message to the Control. So perhaps the treatment variable is a binary variable (1 if Neighbors, 0 otherwise), and the other messages (Civic Duty and Hawthorne) are considered as part of the control group or as confounders.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to compare each message type against the Control, perhaps we need to run separate analyses. But given the problem's wording, we need to focus on the Neighbors message.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to set up the treatment as a binary variable (Neighbors vs. not Neighbors), and include the other message types (Civic Duty and Hawthorne) as confounders. Because the other messages (Civic Duty and Hawthorne) are potential confounders that need to be adjusted for. Alternatively, since messages are the treatment, and the question is about the effect of Neighbors, perhaps the treatment is the message type, and the other message types are part of the treatment. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says to use a linear regression model with message and age as predictors, perhaps the best way is to use pandas and sklearn's linear regression, not DoWhy. Because DoWhy is for causal inference with more complex methods. However, the user's instruction says to use DoWhy if possible. Let me think again.\n\nIf we can model the effect using DoWhy, perhaps by specifying the treatment as the message (Neighbors), and include other message types as common causes. Wait, no. The treatment is the message received. The messages are the treatment variable. So for the problem, the treatment variable is \"messages\", with four levels. The outcome is primary2006. The confounders would be hhsize, sex, age_in_2006, and primary2004. Wait, the problem says to include age as a predictor. So maybe age_in_2006 is a confounder. But the problem says to include both message and age as predictors. So perhaps the model should adjust for age.\n\nBut the problem is specifically asking for the effect of the Neighbors message on the outcome, adjusting for age. So the treatment variable is whether the message is Neighbors (1) or not (0), and the model adjusts for age. However, there are other messages (Civic Duty, Hawthorne) that are also part of the treatment. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat messages as a categorical variable, with Control as the baseline, and the treatment is the other three types. But since the problem is only interested in the Neighbors message, we need to compare it to Control.\n\nBut in DoWhy, how do we handle this? The CausalModel's treatment parameter is a single variable. So perhaps we need to create a binary treatment variable (1 for Neighbors, 0 otherwise), and include other message types (Civic Duty and Hawthorne) as confounders. Because those other messages are part of the treatment space and may affect the outcome. However, since the problem wants to compare against Control, maybe the treatment is the message type, and the other messages are part of the treatment, but we are focusing on the Neighbors treatment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the messages are the treatment, and the problem is to estimate the effect of each treatment relative to Control. For the purpose of this problem, we need to estimate the effect of the Neighbors treatment.\n\nBut DoWhy's CausalModel requires the treatment to be a single variable. So perhaps we can create a binary variable for Neighbors vs. Control and others. But then we need to adjust for the other message types as confounders. However, the problem says to include message and age as predictors. So perhaps the other message types (Civic Duty and Hawthorne) should be included as confounders. Let me think.\n\nLet me outline the variables:\n\n- Treatment: Neighbors (binary: 1 if message is Neighbors, 0 otherwise)\n- Outcome: primary2006\n- Confounders: age_in_2006, other messages (Civic Duty, Hawthorne), hhsize, sex, primary2004.\n\nWait, but the problem says to include message and age as predictors. So the message is the treatment, but since it's categorical with four levels, we need to create dummy variables. However, the problem is specifically about the effect of the Neighbors message. So maybe the treatment is a dummy variable for Neighbors, and the other message types are included as confounders. For example, if we have:\n\ntreatment = (messages == \"Neighbors\")\nconfounders = age_in_2006, (messages == \"Civic Duty\"), (messages == \"Hawthorne\"), ... etc.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, since the problem says to include message and age as predictors, perhaps the correct approach is to use the messages variable as a categorical variable with four levels, create dummies, and include age_in_2006, then fit a regression model. But how to do this with DoWhy.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem allows using simple pandas methods, perhaps using sklearn's linear regression would be easier.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1. Load the data.\n\n2. Calculate age_in_2006 = 2006 - yearofbirth.\n\n3. Create dummy variables for messages, with Control as the reference category. So we'll have three dummy variables: 'Civic Duty', 'Neighbors', 'Hawthorne'.\n\n4. The model is: primary2006 = intercept + beta1*Civic Duty + beta2*Neighbors + beta3*Hawthorne + beta4*age_in_2006.\n\n5. The coefficient for Neighbors (beta2) is the average causal effect of the Neighbors message compared to Control, adjusted for age.\n\n6. So, fit the model and extract beta2.\n\nBut since the question asks to estimate a linear regression model with both message and age as predictors, this seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python using pandas and sklearn.\n\nBut the user mentioned that the solution can use simple pandas methods. However, the problem requires using DoWhy if possible. Let's try to use DoWhy.\n\nIn DoWhy, the treatment is a single variable. So to model the effect of Neighbors compared to Control, we can set the treatment to be whether the message is Neighbors (binary), and include other message types (Civic Duty and Hawthorne) as common causes. Because those message types are part of the treatment space and could be confounders if not adjusted for. However, the problem says to include message and age as predictors. So perhaps the other messages are part of the treatment and need to be included as confounders.\n\nSo, in the DoWhy model, the treatment is \"is_Neighbors\" (binary), the outcome is \"primary2006\", common_causes include age_in_2006, is_CivicDuty, is_Hawthorne, etc. But this seems a bit messy.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem allows using a simple regression, perhaps using sklearn is easier.\n\nSo, here's how to proceed with code:\n\n- Load data.\n\n- Calculate age_in_2006.\n\n- Filter for age_in_2006 == 25? Or not? Let's recheck the question.\n\nThe question says: \"if the voter's age was 25 in 2006\". So the effect is for those voters who were 25. So we need to filter the data to those voters.\n\nSo first step: filter data to yearofbirth == 1981 (since 2006 - 1981 = 25).\n\nThen, proceed with the regression.\n\nBut in this case, age_in_2006 is fixed at 25. So including age_in_2006 in the model would not vary. However, the problem says to include age as a predictor. So in this case, including it in the model is redundant, but the code can still proceed. The regression would include age as a constant, but the coefficient for the treatment (Neighbors) would still be estimable.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\n1. Load data.\n\n2. Compute age_in_2006 = 2006 - yearofbirth.\n\n3. Filter data to age_in_2006 == 25.\n\n4. Create dummy variables for messages. For example, pd.get_dummies(df['messages'], drop_first=True) would create dummies for Civic Duty, Neighbors, Hawthorne (assuming Control is the first category, which may not be the case. Need to check the data's messages categories).\n\nBut looking at the first 10 rows, messages are: Hawthorne, Control, Neighbors, Control, etc. The possible categories are 'Civic Duty', 'Control', 'Neighbors', 'Hawthorne'.\n\nSo when creating dummies, we need to make sure that the reference category is Control. So using pd.get_dummies with drop_first=True may not be sufficient. Let me check:\n\nIf we have messages with categories A, B, C, D, and we want to use A as reference, then we need to set the categories and drop_first accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, create a dummy variable for each of the other three messages, with Control as the baseline.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndf_filtered = df[df['yearofbirth'] == 1981]\n\nThen, create dummies for messages:\n\nmessages_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df_filtered['messages'], prefix='message', drop_first=False)\n\nBut drop_first=False gives all four dummies. Then, we can drop the Control column to use as reference.\n\nmessages_dummies = messages_dummies.drop(columns=['Control'])\n\nThen, the model would include the three dummies (Civic Duty, Neighbors, Hawthorne) and age_in_2006.\n\nBut since age_in_2006 is fixed at 25, the coefficient for age would be zero, but it's included in the model.\n\nNow, fit the linear regression model.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('social.csv')\ndf['age_in_2006'] = 2006 - df['yearofbirth']\ndf_filtered = df[df['age_in_2006'] == 25]\n\nmessages_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df_filtered['messages'], drop_first=False)\nmessages_dummies = messages_dummies.drop(columns=['Control'])  # assuming Control is the reference\n\nX = pd.concat([messages_dummies, df_filtered[['age_in_2006']]], axis=1)\ny = df_filtered['primary2006']\n\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X, y)\n\nneighbors_coeff = model.coef_[messages_dummies.columns.get_loc('Neighbors')]\neffect = neighbors_coeff\n\nrounded_effect = round(effect, 3)\n\nreturn rounded_effect\n\nBut wait, the coefficients would be for each of the dummy variables. Since Control is the reference, the coefficient for Neighbors is the difference between Neighbors and Control, adjusted for age (which is fixed).\n\nThis should give the desired effect.\n\nNow, the problem says to use DoWhy, but since the data is filtered and the regression is simple, using DoWhy may not be necessary. However, let's see if we can use DoWhy for this.\n\nUsing DoWhy for this scenario:\n\nThe treatment is whether the message is Neighbors. So create a binary variable 'is_Neighbors' which is 1 if messages is Neighbors, else 0.\n\nThe common causes would be age_in_2006, and possibly other message types (Civic Duty, Hawthorne). However, since we have already filtered the data to age=25, age_in_2006 is fixed. So common_causes may include other variables, but since the problem says to include age as a predictor, and we are already filtering it to 25, perhaps the common_causes is an empty list.\n\nBut in the DoWhy model, common_causes are variables that cause both treatment and outcome. Since we've filtered age, perhaps there are no other confounders. But the problem says to include age as a predictor, which we have already done via filtering. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem allows using simple regression, the code above using sklearn is sufficient. The answer is the coefficient for the Neighbors dummy variable in the regression model, rounded to three decimal places.\n\nBut I need to check if the code is correct. Let me test with the first 10 rows.\n\nLooking at the first 10 rows:\n\nFor example, the third row is female, 1964 (age_in_2006 = 2006-1964=42), so not 25. So in the filtered data, only rows where yearofbirth is 1981 (age 25) are included.\n\nAssuming that the dataset has such rows.\n\nNow, the code would filter the data to those with age_in_2006 == 25, create dummies for messages, drop the Control dummy, and fit the regression. The coefficient for Neighbors would be the effect.\n\nThe problem says to round to the nearest thousandth, so three decimal places.\n\nThus, the solution function would be as outlined above.\n\nNow, putting this into code, without using DoWhy, since the problem allows it if possible.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef solution():\n    import pandas as pd\n    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n    df = pd.read_csv('social.csv')\n    df['age_in_2006'] = 2006 - df['yearofbirth']\n    df_filtered = df[df['age_in_2006'] == 25]\n\n    # Create dummy variables for messages, dropping Control\n    messages_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df_filtered['messages'], drop_first=False)\n    messages_dummies = messages_dummies.drop(columns=['Control'])  # assuming 'Control' is the reference\n\n    X = messages_dummies.join(df_filtered['age_in_2006'])\n    y = df_filtered['primary2006']\n\n    model = LinearRegression()\n    model.fit(X, y)\n\n    # Get the coefficient for the 'Neighbors' message\n    neighbors_coeff = model.coef_[messages_dummies.columns.get_loc('Neighbors')]\n    return round(neighbors_coeff, 3)\n\nWait, but the code may have an issue if the messages_dummies does not have a column named 'Neighbors'. We need to ensure that the dummy variables are properly created. Let's see: when we use pd.get_dummies(df_filtered['messages'], drop_first=False), it creates columns for all four message types. Then, we drop the 'Control' column. So the remaining columns are 'Civic Duty', 'Hawthorne', 'Neighbors'.\n\nThe model includes these three dummies and age_in_2006. The coefficient for 'Neighbors' is the effect compared to Control.\n\nBut in the code, messages_dummies.columns.get_loc('Neighbors') may raise an error if 'Neighbors' is not present. So we need to make sure that the dummy variables have this column. Alternatively, use the .loc accessor.\n\nAlternatively, we can select the coefficient for the 'Neighbors' column directly.\n\nAnother approach: create the dummy variables with Control as the reference.\n\nAlternatively, use treatment contrasts.\n\nBut given that the code is correct, the function should work.\n\nBut the problem says to use DoWhy if possible. However, since the problem can be solved with a simple regression, perhaps it's acceptable to use sklearn.\n\nBut let me think if there's a way to use DoWhy for this. For example, by specifying the treatment as 'is_Neighbors', the outcome as 'primary2006', and common_causes as ['age_in_2006'].\n\nBut since we've already filtered the data to age_in_2006 == 25, the common_causes would be empty. Because age_in_2006 is fixed. So:\n\nmodel = CausalModel(\n    data=df_filtered,\n    treatment='is_Neighbors',\n    outcome='primary2006',\n    common_causes=[]  # since age is fixed\n)\n\nThen estimate the effect using backdoor.linear_regression.\n\nBut since common_causes is empty, the model would just fit a regression of outcome on treatment and no other variables. However, we need to include age_in_2006 as a predictor, which is fixed. But including a fixed variable in the regression is redundant. So perhaps using DoWhy here is not appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the sklearn-based regression model as outlined.\n\nNow, test the code with the first 10 rows. However, since the first 10 rows do not include any voters aged 25 (since for example, the first row has yearofbirth 1965, age_in_2006 = 41, etc.), the filtered data may be empty. But the actual dataset likely has such voters.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this code.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    import pandas as pd\n    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n    df = pd.read_csv('social.csv')\n    df['age_in_2006'] = 2006 - df['yearofbirth']\n    df_filtered = df[df['age_in_2006'] == 25]\n\n    # Create dummy variables for messages, dropping 'Control' as the reference category\n    messages_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df_filtered['messages'], drop_first=False)\n    messages_dummies = messages_dummies.drop(columns=['Control'])\n\n    # Combine with age_in_2006\n    X = messages_dummies.join(df_filtered['age_in_2006'])\n    y = df_filtered['primary2006']\n\n    model = LinearRegression()\n    model.fit(X, y)\n\n    # Get the coefficient for the 'Neighbors' message\n    neighbors_coeff = model.coef_[X.columns.get_loc('Neighbors')]\n    return round(neighbors_coeff, 3)\n```"}
