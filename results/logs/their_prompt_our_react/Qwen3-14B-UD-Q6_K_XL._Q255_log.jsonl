We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Outcome estimation\nUse linear regression.\n\nmodel = dowhy.CausalModel(\n    data=df\n    treatment=\"treatment_col\"\n    outcome=\"outcome_col\"\n    common_causes=[...] #confounders. Be careful to include the right variables here!\n)\n\nidentified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nAlternatively, you could use the causalinference library, which supports bias adjustment. \n\ncm = causalinference.CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"outcome\"].values, \n    D=med[\"treatment\"].values, \n    X=med[[confounders]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nreturn cm.estimates[\"matching\"][\"ate\"]\n\n\nMethod 3: Difference in differences\nSeperate the data into the treated and control groups at the different time steps.\n\nfilter = lambda a, b: df[\"outcome\"].where(df[\"time\"]==a & df[\"treatment\"]==b)\n\ntreated_before, treated_after, control_before, control_after = filter(0, 1), filter(1, 1), filter(0, 0), filter(1, 0)\n\nreturn (treated_after.mean()-treated_before.mean())-(control_after.mean()-control_before.mean())\n\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\n                                              \nMethod 5: Propensity Score Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\n                                            \nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\n        \nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\n\n\nMethod 8: Doubly Robust Estimation\nCombine outcome modelling and propensity scores. Here is an example using sklearn\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, LinearRegression\n\ndef doubly_robust(df, X, T, Y):\n    ps = LogisticRegression(C=1e6, max_iter=1000).fit(df[X], df[T]).predict_proba(df[X])[:, 1]\n    mu0 = LinearRegression().fit(df.query(f\"{T}==0\")[X], df.query(f\"{T}==0\")[Y]).predict(df[X])\n    mu1 = LinearRegression().fit(df.query(f\"{T}==1\")[X], df.query(f\"{T}==1\")[Y]).predict(df[X])\n    return (\n        np.mean(df[T]*(df[Y] - mu1)/ps + mu1) -\n        np.mean((1-df[T])*(df[Y] - mu0)/(1-ps) + mu0)\n    )\n                       \n\n        \nData Description:\nThe National Study of Learning Mindsets is a randomised study conducted in U.S. public high schools which aims at finding the impact of a growth mindset. The way it works is that students receive from the school a seminar to instill in them a growth mindset.
