We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Outcome estimation\nUse linear regression.\n\nmodel = dowhy.CausalModel(\n    data=df\n    treatment=\"treatment_col\"\n    outcome=\"outcome_col\"\n    common_causes=[...] #confounders. Be careful to include the right variables here!\n)\n\nidentified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nAlternatively, you could use the causalinference library, which supports bias adjustment. \n\ncm = causalinference.CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"outcome\"].values, \n    D=med[\"treatment\"].values, \n    X=med[[confounders]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nreturn cm.estimates[\"matching\"][\"ate\"]\n\n\nMethod 3: Difference in differences\nSeperate the data into the treated and control groups at the different time steps.\n\nfilter = lambda a, b: df[\"outcome\"].where(df[\"time\"]==a & df[\"treatment\"]==b)\n\ntreated_before, treated_after, control_before, control_after = filter(0, 1), filter(1, 1), filter(0, 0), filter(1, 0)\n\nreturn (treated_after.mean()-treated_before.mean())-(control_after.mean()-control_before.mean())\n\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\n                                              \nMethod 5: Propensity Score Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\n                                            \nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\n        \nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\n\n\nMethod 8: Doubly Robust Estimation\nCombine outcome modelling and propensity scores. Here is an example using sklearn\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, LinearRegression\n\ndef doubly_robust(df, X, T, Y):\n    ps = LogisticRegression(C=1e6, max_iter=1000).fit(df[X], df[T]).predict_proba(df[X])[:, 1]\n    mu0 = LinearRegression().fit(df.query(f\"{T}==0\")[X], df.query(f\"{T}==0\")[Y]).predict(df[X])\n    mu1 = LinearRegression().fit(df.query(f\"{T}==1\")[X], df.query(f\"{T}==1\")[Y]).predict(df[X])\n    return (\n        np.mean(df[T]*(df[Y] - mu1)/ps + mu1) -\n        np.mean((1-df[T])*(df[Y] - mu0)/(1-ps) + mu0)\n    )\n                       \n\n        \nData Description:\nThree social scientists conducted an RCT in which they investigated whether social pressure within neighborhoods increases participation. Specifically, during a primary election in the state of Michigan, they randomly assigned registered voters to receive different get-out-the-vote (GOTV) messages and examined whether sending postcards with these messages increased turnout. The researchers exploited the fact that the turnout of individual voters is public information in the United States. The GOTV message of particular interest was designed to induce social pressure by telling voters that after the election their neighbors would be informed about whether they voted in the election or not. The researchers hypothesized that such a namingand-shaming GOTV strategy would increase participation.\nThere are three treatment groups: voters who receive either the social pressure message, the civic duty message, or the Hawthorne effect message. The Hawthorne effect refers to the phenomenon where study subjects behave differently because they know they are being observed by researchers. The experiment also has a control group which consists of those voters receiving no message. The researchers randomly assigned each voter to one of the four groups and examined whether the voter turnout was different across the groups.\n\nThe data is in the file social.csv.\nVariable Description\nhhsize: household size of the voter\nmessages: GOTV messages the voter received (Civic Duty, Control, Neighbors, Hawthorne)\nsex: sex of the voter (female or male)\nyearofbirth: year of birth of the voter\nprimary2004: whether the voter voted in the 2004 primary election (1=voted, 0=abstained)\nprimary2006: whether the voter turned out in the 2006 primary election (1=voted, 0=abstained)\nFirst 5 rows of the data:\nocial:\nsex  yearofbirth  primary2004   messages  primary2006  hhsize\n252297  female         1965            0  Hawthorne            0       2\n183316  female         1953            1    Control            1       3\n13563   female         1964            0  Neighbors            1       2\n278587  female         1946            0    Control            1       3\n197879    male         1983            0  Hawthorne            0       4\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average causal effect of the Neighbors message on whether the voter voted in the 2006 primary election if the voter's age was 25 in 2006?
