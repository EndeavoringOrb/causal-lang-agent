We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Regression\nUse linear regression.\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nMethod 3: Propensity Score Stratification\nWe will be using propensity scores to stratify units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_strat = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_stratification\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\")\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\nAlternatively, Causalinference has a simple way to train bias adjusted matching estimators:\nfrom causalinference import CausalModel\n\ncm = CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"recovery\"].values, \n    D=med[\"medication\"].values, \n    X=med[[\"severity\", \"age\", \"sex\"]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nprint(cm.estimates)\n\nMethod 5: Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\nData Description:\nWe are trying to estimate the effect of a trainee program on earnings. Data in the CSV file trainee_unique_on_age.csv contains trainee status, age, and earnings of each unit. Trainees are much younger than non trainees, which indicates that age is probably a confounder.\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\ntrainee_unique_on_age:\nunit  trainees  age  earnings\n0      1         1   28     17700\n5      6         1   23     28600\n34    36         0   24      9700\n13    14         1   24     19700\n44    24         0   54     41100\n52    34         0   34     24200\n37    39         0   32     17800\n25    26         0   39     42000\n46    26         0   39     42000\n12    13         1   29     12500\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the Average Treatment Effect on the treated (ATT) of the trainee program on earnings, as estimated by a matching estimator? Please round the final answer to the nearest hundredth. The answer is positive if the trainee program increases the earnings."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the task is to estimate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) of a trainee program on earnings using a matching estimator. The data includes whether someone was a trainee, their age, and their earnings. The first thing I need to do is understand the setup.\n\nThe dataset has columns 'trainees', 'age', and 'earnings'. The treatment variable is 'trainees' (probably 1 for treated, 0 for control), and the outcome is 'earnings'. The problem mentions that age is a confounder because trainees are younger. So, when estimating the effect of the trainee program, we need to account for age differences between the groups.\n\nThe ATT is the average effect of the treatment on those who actually received the treatment. So, we want to compare the earnings of trainees to a matched group of non-trainees who are similar in terms of age and other variables (though here it seems age is the main confounder).\n\nSince the question specifies using a matching estimator, I should think about which method in DoWhy or other libraries can handle that. The user mentioned using DoWhy, but there's also an example with the Causalinference library's CausalModel which does matching. Let me recall the example provided.\n\nIn the examples, there's a Causalinference example where they use cm.est_via_matching with matches=1 and bias_adj=True. That might be a simpler approach here. Alternatively, using DoWhy's estimate_effect with method_name like backdoor.propensity_score_matching. The ATT is the target here, so I need to specify target_units=\"att\".\n\nWait, the question says \"matching estimator\", which could refer to either propensity score matching or distance matching. Let me check the DoWhy methods. The DoWhy example for distance matching uses method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\", but for propensity score matching, it's \"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\". The Causalinference approach is another form of matching.\n\nWhich one should I use here? The problem doesn't specify, but since there's a direct example with Causalinference, maybe that's an option. However, the user's instruction says \"use the DoWhy library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation.\" So perhaps I should stick with DoWhy.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Identify treatment and outcome. Treatment is 'trainees', outcome is 'earnings'.\n\n2. Identify method: Since we need to use a matching estimator, propensity score matching or distance matching. The ATT is required.\n\n3. Adjust for confounders. The only confounder mentioned is age, so common_causes should be ['age'].\n\n4. The data doesn't seem to need transformation except for handling the treatment and outcome.\n\nSo the DoWhy code would create a CausalModel with treatment='trainees', outcome='earnings', common_causes=['age'].\n\nThen identify the effect, and estimate using backdoor.propensity_score_matching with target_units=\"att\".\n\nAlternatively, the distance matching method could be used, specifying a distance metric. But since the example for DoWhy uses propensity score matching for ATT, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nLet me look at the DoWhy example again. For example, the code for propensity score matching uses method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\" and target_units=\"atc\" (for ATC). To get ATT, perhaps changing target_units to \"att\".\n\nSo the model.estimate_effect would be called with method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\" and target_units=\"att\".\n\nBut I need to check if that's a valid parameter. The DoWhy documentation for estimate_effect mentions target_units can be \"ate\", \"att\", or \"atc\".\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nmodel = CausalModel(\n    data=data,\n    treatment='trainees',\n    outcome='earnings',\n    common_causes=['age']\n)\n\nidentified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\nestimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\", target_units=\"att\")\n\nThen return estimate.value.\n\nAlternatively, the example in the problem's given examples uses Causalinference's CausalModel for matching. But the user says \"you should use the DoWhy library\". However, if DoWhy's method isn't working for ATT, maybe using Causalinference is allowed. But the user's instruction says \"you should use the DoWhy library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation.\" So probably need to use DoWhy.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the solution function must be defined\" and the code must be in the format with the solution() function. So I need to write code that uses DoWhy, unless the data is structured such that simple pandas methods can be used. But given that there's confounding (age), we need to adjust for it, which matching does.\n\nLet me test this approach. The code would be:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(\"trainee_unique_on_age.csv\")\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"trainees\",\n        outcome = \"earnings\",\n        common_causes = [\"age\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\", target_units=\"att\")\n    return round(estimate.value, 2)\n\nBut I need to make sure that DoWhy supports the target_units=\"att\" for propensity score matching. Looking at the DoWhy documentation for estimate_effect, the target_units parameter is available. For example, in the examples provided, for propensity_score_matching, the target_units is set to \"atc\". So for ATT, setting target_units=\"att\" should work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct method for ATT with matching is to use the \"backdoor.matching\" method. Wait, in the DoWhy examples given, the available methods include backdoor.propensity_score_matching, backdoor.linear_regression, etc. There's no mention of a \"distance_matching\" in the method names. Wait, the user's example shows method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\", but maybe that's a typo? Because in the DoWhy documentation, the available methods are listed as:\n\nFor backdoor, methods like propensity_score_matching, linear_regression, generalized_linear_model, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps using backdoor.propensity_score_matching is the correct approach here.\n\nAnother thing to consider: ATT in DoWhy. The target_units parameter for estimate_effect can be \"att\", so that should be the way.\n\nNow, let me think about the data. The first few rows show that trainees (trainees=1) have lower age. The earnings vary. The ATT is the effect on the treated (those who were trainees). So, we match each treated unit with a non-treated unit with similar age, then compare earnings.\n\nAnother possible approach is using the Causalinference library, which is mentioned in the examples. The code would be:\n\nfrom causalinference import CausalModel\n\ncm = CausalModel(\n    Y=data['earnings'].values, \n    D=data['trainees'].values, \n    X=data['age'].values\n)\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\nprint(cm.estimates)\n\nBut the user's instruction says to use DoWhy. However, if DoWhy's method isn't working, perhaps using Causalinference is acceptable. However, the user says \"you should use the DoWhy library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation. The steps you should take...\" So probably, we need to use DoWhy.\n\nBut to check, maybe the answer is better using Causalinference. But the user's code example for the Causalinference approach is provided in the examples. However, the problem says that the solution function must be defined with the code.\n\nSo, I need to proceed with DoWhy. Let me proceed with the code as outlined.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the code is correct. For instance, the common_causes is set to ['age'], which is correct because age is the confounder. The treatment is 'trainees' and outcome is 'earnings'.\n\nOnce the model is built, identify_effect() is called, and then estimate_effect with the correct method and target_units.\n\nAnother thing: DoWhy's estimate_effect for propensity score matching might require some parameters. For example, in the method_params, maybe specifying some parameters. But in the example given in the user's examples, the method_params are not used for the propensity score matching example. So perhaps it's okay to not include them here.\n\nNow, let's think about the answer. The ATT is the average treatment effect on the treated. Let's say the code runs and returns a value. Then we round it to the nearest hundredth.\n\nBut perhaps there are some issues. For example, if the data has multiple variables, but in this case, only 'age' is a confounder.\n\nAnother consideration: the data might have other variables, but according to the data description, it's only 'unit', 'trainees', 'age', and 'earnings'. The 'unit' might be an index, so not relevant. So the code is okay.\n\nSo, the code would be as follows:\n\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(\"trainee_unique_on_age.csv\")\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data = data,\n        treatment = \"trainees\",\n        outcome = \"earnings\",\n        common_causes = [\"age\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\", target_units=\"att\")\n    return round(estimate.value, 2)\n\nBut wait, the first argument to CausalModel's estimate_effect is the identified_estimand. But sometimes, if the identification step fails, this could be an issue. However, given that we have provided common_causes, the identification should proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should include more parameters. For example, in the __init__ method of CausalModel, the estimand_type is \"nonparametric-ate\" by default. Since we want ATT, maybe we need to set estimand_type to \"nonparametric-att\"? Wait, the __init__ parameters include estimand_type, but the default is \"nonparametric-ate\". However, when calling identify_effect(), the estimand_type can be specified. But maybe it's handled automatically when we specify target_units in estimate_effect.\n\nAlternatively, during identification, the estimand_type can be set. But the user's code example for the CausalModel doesn't specify that. Let me check the documentation for the CausalModel's identify_effect method. The estimand_type can be passed in, but perhaps the default is sufficient. The identification step should generate an estimand that corresponds to the ATT, given that we're using target_units=\"att\" during estimation.\n\nAnother possible issue: DoWhy's propensity score matching for ATT. The target_units parameter in estimate_effect is set to \"att\", which should make it calculate the ATT. I think that's correct.\n\nNow, what if there's a problem with the code? For instance, if the CausalModel cannot identify the effect without a graph. The CausalModel requires either a graph, common_causes, or instruments. In this case, we have provided common_causes, so it's okay.\n\nAnother thing: the data might have other variables, but according to the first 10 rows, there's 'unit' which is probably an identifier, but not a confounder. So it's okay to ignore it.\n\nSo, the code should work. Now, the answer would be the value returned by estimate.value, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut let me test with some sample data. Suppose in the first 10 rows, the treated (trainees=1) have earnings like 17700, 28600, 19700, 12500. The non-treated have 9700, 41100, etc. But age is lower for treated. So matching on age would adjust for this.\n\nBut since the actual data is in a CSV, the code would process all rows.\n\nAnother possible issue: the code uses the entire dataset. The problem says to analyze the first 10 rows, but the code should process the whole table. The first 10 rows are just for analysis, but the code should read the full data.\n\nTherefore, the code as written should be correct.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    data = pd.read_csv(\"trainee_unique_on_age.csv\")\n\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment=\"trainees\",\n        outcome=\"earnings\",\n        common_causes=[\"age\"]\n    )\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n    estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\", target_units=\"att\")\n    return round(estimate.value, 2)\n```"}
