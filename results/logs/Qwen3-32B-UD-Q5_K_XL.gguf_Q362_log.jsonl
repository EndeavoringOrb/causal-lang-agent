The description and the question can be found below. Please analyze the first 10 rows of the table and write \npython code to analyze the whole table. You should use the DoWhy library to build a causal model and perform effect estimation. The steps you should take are: \n1. Identify treatment and effect.\n2. Identify which method to use to estimate the effect, for example outcome modeling, propensity scores, difference in differences, instrumental variables, etc.\n3. Identify which tools to use. For example, for propensity score matching you could use causalinference CausalModel, and for outcome modelling you could use Dowhy CausalModel with backdoor.linear_regression.\n4. Identify variables to adjust for. These could be confounders/common causes, instrumental variables, etc.\n5. Identify how (if necessary) to transform the data. For example, in difference in differences, you would need to separate the data based on time and treatment.\n6. Write code to estimate the effect and return it.\nYou do not have to use dowhy.

We will load in a sample dataset and use different methods for estimating the causal effect of a (pre-specified)treatment variable on a (pre-specified) outcome variable.\n\nMethod 1: Regression\nUse linear regression.\n\ncausal_estimate_reg = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"backdoor.linear_regression\",\n        test_significance=True)\n\n\nMethod 2: Distance Matching\nDefine a distance metric and then use the metric to match closest points between treatment and control.\n\ncausal_estimate_dmatch = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.distance_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\",\n                                              method_params={'distance_metric':\"minkowski\", 'p':2}) #euclidean distance\n\nMethod 3: Propensity Score Stratification\nWe will be using propensity scores to stratify units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_strat = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_stratification\",\n                                              target_units=\"att\")\n\nMethod 4: Propensity Score Matching\nWe will be using propensity scores to match units in the data.\n\ncausal_estimate_match = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                              method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_matching\",\n                                              target_units=\"atc\")\n\nAlternatively, Causalinference has a simple way to train bias adjusted matching estimators:\nfrom causalinference import CausalModel\n\ncm = CausalModel(\n    Y=med[\"recovery\"].values, \n    D=med[\"medication\"].values, \n    X=med[[\"severity\", \"age\", \"sex\"]].values\n)\n\ncm.est_via_matching(matches=1, bias_adj=True)\n\nprint(cm.estimates)\n\nMethod 5: Weighting\nWe will be using (inverse) propensity scores to assign weights to units in the data. DoWhy supports a few different weighting schemes: 1. Vanilla Inverse Propensity Score weighting (IPS) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_weight\u201d) 2. Self-normalized IPS weighting (also known as the Hajek estimator) (weighting_scheme=\u201cips_normalized_weight\u201d) 3. Stabilized IPS weighting (weighting_scheme = \u201cips_stabilized_weight\u201d)\n\ncausal_estimate_ipw = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                            method_name=\"backdoor.propensity_score_weighting\",\n                                            target_units = \"ate\",\n                                            method_params={\"weighting_scheme\":\"ips_weight\"})\n\nMethod 6: Instrumental Variable\nWe will be using the Wald estimator for the provided instrumental variable.\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\nMethod 7: Regression Discontinuity\nWe will be internally converting this to an equivalent instrumental variables problem.\n\ncausal_estimate_regdist = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.regression_discontinuity\",\n        method_params={'rd_variable_name':'Z1',\n                       'rd_threshold_value':0.5,\n                       'rd_bandwidth': 0.15})\nData Description:\nThe dataset provided, ak91.csv, contains information on individuals' log wages, years of schooling, year of birth, quarter of birth, and state of birth. The purpose of the analysis is to estimate the effect of education on wage, using linear regression and quarter of birth as an instrumental variable (IV). This idea takes advantage of US compulsory attendance law. Usually, they state that a kid must have turned 6 years by January 1 of the year they enter school. For this reason, kids that are born at the beginning of the year will enter school at an older age. Compulsory attendance law also requires students to be in school until they turn 16, at which point they are legally allowed to drop out. The result is that people born later in the year have, on average, more years of education than those born in the beginning of the year.\nFirst 10 rows of the data:\nak91:\nlog_wage  years_of_schooling  ...  quarter_of_birth  state_of_birth\n12663   5.657537                12.0  ...               2.0            37.0\n186092  5.729413                12.0  ...               4.0            26.0\n323078  5.971311                12.0  ...               4.0            26.0\n152372  6.047781                10.0  ...               4.0            17.0\n94610   5.952494                 8.0  ...               4.0            28.0\n124647  5.901214                12.0  ...               4.0            40.0\n255146  5.605873                12.0  ...               4.0            55.0\n93625   6.357876                13.0  ...               4.0            51.0\n80347   5.237107                 8.0  ...               3.0            36.0\n291350  5.818998                11.0  ...               4.0             5.0\n\n[10 rows x 5 columns]\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average additional percentage wage increase associated with each additional year of education based on the instrumental variable of whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4?

{"role": "assistant", "content": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to estimate the effect of education on wages using an instrumental variable, specifically quarter of birth (Q4). The data includes log_wage, years_of_schooling, year_of_birth, quarter_of_birth, and state_of_birth. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how instrumental variables work. The idea is that the instrument (Q4 here) affects the treatment (education) but doesn't directly affect the outcome (wage) except through the treatment. Since Q4 is used as an IV, we're probably going to use the Wald estimator or a more sophisticated IV regression method.\n\nThe user mentioned adjusting for all other variables. The other variables in the dataset are year_of_birth and state_of_birth. So those should be included as covariates in the model. \n\nIn the DoWhy library, the instrumental variable method can be applied by specifying the instrument. The treatment here is years_of_schooling, and the outcome is log_wage. The instrument is quarter_of_birth, but we need to check if it's Q4 specifically. Wait, the question says \"whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4\". So maybe the instrument is a binary variable indicating if the quarter is Q4. But in the data, quarter_of_birth is already a numerical variable (like 2.0, 4.0, etc.). So perhaps we need to create a binary instrument where it's 1 if quarter_of_birth is 4 and 0 otherwise. \n\nWait, the original problem says that people born later in the year have more education. The quarter_of_birth is the instrument. The idea is that being born in a certain quarter affects the years of schooling due to the school cutoff dates. So, for IV, we need to use quarter_of_birth as the instrument. But maybe the original study uses Q1, Q2, Q3 as instruments, but the question specifically refers to Q4. Hmm, but the data's quarter_of_birth is already a categorical variable (probably 1, 2, 3, 4). However, the question asks about being born in the last quarter (Q4) as the instrumental variable. So perhaps we need to create a binary variable (let's call it 'q4') which is 1 if quarter_of_birth is 4, else 0. \n\nBut wait, the user's question says to use \"whether the individual is born in the last quarter q4\" as the instrumental variable. So the instrument is a binary variable indicating Q4. However, in the data, quarter_of_birth is a numerical column (values like 2.0, 4.0, etc.). So, first, we need to process the data to create a binary instrument variable, say 'q4', which is 1 when quarter_of_birth equals 4, 0 otherwise. \n\nBut let's check the first 10 rows. For example, the first row has quarter_of_birth 2.0, so q4 would be 0. The second row has 4.0, so 1. So yes, creating this binary variable is necessary. \n\nNow, the treatment is 'years_of_schooling', the outcome is 'log_wage'. The instrument is this new 'q4' variable. Also, the user says to adjust for all other variables, which are year_of_birth and state_of_birth. \n\nIn the DoWhy CausalModel, when using instrumental variables, we need to specify the instrument. So in the model, the common_causes would be the confounders. But in IV approach, the key is that the instrument is not a confounder but an instrument. So, the common_causes (confounders) here would be the variables that affect both treatment and outcome. However, since we're using IV, maybe the other variables (year_of_birth and state_of_birth) should be included as covariates. \n\nWait, in IV estimation, the model typically includes the instrument, the treatment, the outcome, and other covariates. The approach is two-stage least squares (2SLS), where the first stage regresses the treatment on the instrument and covariates, and the second stage regresses the outcome on the treatment and covariates, using the predicted treatment from the first stage. \n\nSo in DoWhy, when using the instrumental variable method, the CausalModel should have the treatment, outcome, instruments, and common_causes (if any). But what are the common_causes here? The common causes (confounders) are variables that affect both the treatment (education) and the outcome (wage). For example, year_of_birth might affect both education (someone born earlier may have different schooling opportunities) and wage. Similarly, state_of_birth could influence both. So these variables need to be controlled for. \n\nTherefore, in the CausalModel, the common_causes should be ['year_of_birth', 'state_of_birth'], the treatment is 'years_of_schooling', the outcome is 'log_wage', and the instruments is ['q4'] (the binary variable we created). \n\nBut first, we need to process the data: create the 'q4' variable. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Load the data from ak91.csv.\n2. Create a new column 'q4' which is 1 if quarter_of_birth is 4, else 0.\n3. Define the treatment as 'years_of_schooling', outcome as 'log_wage', instruments as 'q4', and common_causes as ['year_of_birth', 'state_of_birth'].\n4. Use DoWhy's CausalModel with these parameters.\n5. Identify the effect using the instrumental variable method.\n6. Estimate the effect using the IV method (probably \"iv.instrumental_variable\").\n7. The result will be the causal effect of an additional year of education on log_wage. Since the outcome is log_wage, the coefficient can be interpreted as a percentage change. For example, a coefficient of 0.1 would imply a 10% increase in wage per additional year of education.\n\nWait, the user asked for the average additional percentage wage increase. Since log_wage is the outcome, the effect estimated would be in log points. A 0.01 increase in log(wage) is approximately a 1% increase. So after estimating the effect, we can convert it to a percentage by multiplying by 100. Also, the question says to round to the nearest hundredth of a percent, so two decimal places.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\n- Read the data.\n- Create the 'q4' variable.\n- Then, build the CausalModel with treatment='years_of_schooling', outcome='log_wage', instruments=['q4'], common_causes=['year_of_birth', 'state_of_birth'].\n- Identify the effect.\n- Estimate using IV method.\n\nBut wait, the DoWhy's IV method requires the instrument to be specified. Also, in the method_params, we may need to specify the instrument's name. \n\nIn the example given for instrumental variable in DoWhy, the code is:\n\ncausal_estimate_iv = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n        method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\", method_params = {'iv_instrument_name': 'Z0'})\n\nSo, in our case, the instrument is 'q4', so the method_params should be {'iv_instrument_name': 'q4'}.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut first, check if the data has the required variables. The original data has log_wage, years_of_schooling, year_of_birth, quarter_of_birth, and state_of_birth. So, after creating 'q4', we can proceed.\n\nAnother thing: the user says to adjust for all other variables. The other variables besides the treatment, outcome, and instrument are year_of_birth and state_of_birth. So those should be included as common_causes.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\ndef solution():\n    import pandas as pd\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n\n    # Load data\n    data = pd.read_csv(\"ak91.csv\")\n\n    # Create q4 binary variable\n    data['q4'] = (data['quarter_of_birth'] == 4.0).astype(int)\n\n    # Define treatment, outcome, instruments, common_causes\n    treatment = 'years_of_schooling'\n    outcome = 'log_wage'\n    instruments = ['q4']\n    common_causes = ['year_of_birth', 'state_of_birth']\n\n    # Build the model\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment=treatment,\n        outcome=outcome,\n        common_causes=common_causes,\n        instruments=instruments\n    )\n\n    # Identify the effect\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\n    # Estimate the effect using IV method\n    estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                     method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\",\n                                     method_params={'iv_instrument_name': 'q4'})\n\n    # Convert log points to percentage and round to two decimal places\n    percentage_increase = (np.exp(estimate.value) - 1) * 100  # Wait, no! Wait, if the estimate is the coefficient of years_of_schooling in the log model, then each additional year would multiply wage by exp(coef). So the percentage is (exp(coef) - 1) * 100. But if the model is linear in log(wage), then the coefficient is the change in log(wage) per unit treatment. For small coefficients, log(wage) increase of x is approx x*100% increase. But for accuracy, maybe better to use exact calculation.\n\n    # However, if the model is a linear regression of log_wage on years_of_schooling, then the coefficient is the ceteris paribus change in log(wage) for a 1 unit increase in years_of_schooling. For example, if the coefficient is 0.05, then a 1 year increase in education leads to 5% higher wage. But this approximation holds when the coefficient is small. For larger coefficients, using exp(coef) - 1 is more accurate. But since we're using IV, which estimates the local average treatment effect (LATE), the estimate from the IV method (2SLS) would be the coefficient in the second stage. So, the value from the estimate is the coefficient in log(wage) terms. So, to convert to percentage, multiply by 100 and then say that each additional year of education increases wage by that percentage.\n\n    # Wait, let me think again. In the model log(wage) = beta * education + ... So, a 1 unit increase in education leads to a beta increase in log(wage). The percentage increase is approximately (beta * 100)%. Because d(log(wage)) \u00e2\u0089\u0088 (d wage)/wage. So beta is approximately the percent change in wage per year of education. So if the estimate is 0.1, then 10% increase. Therefore, the answer is estimate.value * 100, rounded to two decimals.\n\n    # So the code would be:\n\n    # Since the outcome is log_wage, the coefficient is the change in log(wage) per year of education. Multiply by 100 to get percentage.\n    percentage_effect = estimate.value * 100\n    return round(percentage_effect, 2)\n\nWait, but the IV method gives an estimate of the effect. The estimate.value is the coefficient. So if the coefficient is 0.05, then 5% increase. So yes, multiply by 100 and round. \n\nBut need to confirm how DoWhy's IV estimation returns the value. Let me check the examples. For example, in the DoWhy IV example, the effect is printed as a value. Assuming that the estimate.value is the causal effect in the units of the outcome variable. Since the outcome is log_wage, then yes, multiplying by 100 gives the percentage increase.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nreturn round(estimate.value * 100, 2)\n\nNow, putting all together in code.\n\nBut wait, the code must create the 'q4' variable. Let's make sure that the quarter_of_birth is a float. In the data sample, it's 2.0, 4.0, etc. So comparing to 4.0 is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the state_of_birth is a categorical variable? Probably, as it's state codes. But in the model, when using linear regression (as part of the IV estimation), it's included as a continuous variable. However, state_of_birth is a categorical variable (state codes are integers but not meaningful as continuous). So maybe we should convert it to a categorical and then one-hot encode it. However, DoWhy's CausalModel might automatically handle this by including it as a common cause, but it depends on how the underlying estimation is done. \n\nBut the user says to adjust for all other variables, so including state_of_birth as a continuous variable may not be correct. However, given the data structure, perhaps in the original dataset, the state_of_birth is already a numerical code (like state abbreviations converted to numbers). In that case, including it as a continuous variable may not be appropriate, and we should convert it to a categorical variable. \n\nBut DoWhy's CausalModel might not automatically do that. So perhaps the code should convert state_of_birth into a categorical variable. For example, using pd.Categorical or creating dummies. However, DoWhy's code may handle this internally when using linear regression, but it's not clear. \n\nBut given that the problem says to adjust for all other variables, perhaps we should proceed with the variables as they are. However, state_of_birth is a categorical variable (state code) and should be treated as such. But in the data, it's stored as a float. So in the model, we need to include it as a categorical variable. How to do that in DoWhy? \n\nWell, when using linear regression in DoWhy (as part of the IV estimation), the code may automatically convert categorical variables if they are of type category. So perhaps we need to convert state_of_birth to a pandas categorical type. \n\nBut the user's code as written may not do that. Let me check. For example, in the code provided by the user's examples, they have variables like 'severity', 'age', 'sex' as X (common causes). So 'sex' would be a categorical variable. So perhaps DoWhy's code automatically handles categorical variables if they are of type category. Therefore, in our case, we should convert state_of_birth to a categorical variable. \n\nSo modifying the code:\n\ndata['state_of_birth'] = data['state_of_birth'].astype('category')\n\nBut DoWhy may not require this, but it's better to ensure. However, the problem says to adjust for all variables. So perhaps the code should proceed as written, assuming that the model can handle the variables. \n\nAlternatively, since the code uses linear regression under the hood for the IV method, we can proceed. For example, in the first stage, years_of_schooling is regressed on the instrument (q4) and the common_causes (year_of_birth, state_of_birth). The state_of_birth is included as a categorical variable. \n\nBut since in the data, state_of_birth is a float, the model would include it as a continuous variable. To properly include it as a categorical variable, we need to create dummy variables. However, DoWhy's CausalModel may not handle that automatically. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach would be to create dummy variables for state_of_birth. However, since the problem says to adjust for all variables, perhaps the code should include state_of_birth as a categorical variable. \n\nBut given that the user's code example for DoWhy's CausalModel just passes the variable names as strings, perhaps the code expects the user to pre-process the data. Therefore, in our case, we need to create dummy variables for state_of_birth. However, the problem says \"adjust for all the other variables\", which in this case are year_of_birth and state_of_birth. \n\nBut the code as written may not do that. So perhaps we need to create dummy variables for state_of_birth. Let's think: \n\nIn the code for the CausalModel, when using the instrumental variable method, the model will include the common_causes as covariates. If the common_causes include a categorical variable, then the code should create dummy variables for it. However, in DoWhy, when using the linear regression methods, does it automatically handle categorical variables? \n\nLooking at the DoWhy documentation, when using backdoor.linear_regression, the code uses patsy to describe the model formula. Patsy automatically converts categorical variables into dummy variables if they are marked as such. So, if in the data, the variables in common_causes are categorical, they will be treated as such. \n\nTherefore, to properly include state_of_birth as a categorical variable, we need to convert it in the data. So:\n\ndata['state_of_birth'] = data['state_of_birth'].astype('category')\n\nBut in the code, the data is read as floats. So the code should convert it. Therefore, modifying the code:\n\ndata['state_of_birth'] = data['state_of_birth'].astype('category')\n\nSimilarly, quarter_of_birth is already a float, but we created 'q4' as a binary variable. \n\nBut the code may not require this conversion, but to be safe, we should do it. \n\nSo adding this line after reading the data:\n\ndata['state_of_birth'] = data['state_of_birth'].astype('category')\n\nBut in the first 10 rows of the data, the state_of_birth values are 37.0, 26.0, etc. These are likely state codes, so converting to category is appropriate. \n\nAnother thing to check: the code for the CausalModel requires that the instruments are provided. Since we have created 'q4' as the instrument, the instruments parameter is ['q4'].\n\nPutting all this together, the code should:\n\n- Read the data.\n- Create 'q4' as (quarter_of_birth == 4.0).\n- Convert state_of_birth to category.\n- Build the model with treatment, outcome, instruments, and common_causes.\n- Identify effect.\n- Estimate using IV method with the instrument name 'q4'.\n- Return the estimate multiplied by 100 and rounded.\n\nNow, let's think about possible errors. For example, if the instrument is weak (i.e., q4 has little effect on years_of_schooling), the IV estimate could be unstable. But the problem doesn't mention handling that. \n\nAnother possible issue: the DoWhy CausalModel requires that the treatment is binary? No, the treatment can be continuous. In this case, years_of_schooling is a continuous variable (e.g., 12.0, 10.0, etc.), so it's okay. \n\nNow, testing the code. Let's see. The code reads the data, creates q4, converts state_of_birth, builds the model, etc. \n\nAnother thing: the DoWhy IV method may require that the instrument is binary. Since q4 is binary (0 or 1), that's okay. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, the final answer is to return the estimated effect multiplied by 100 and rounded to two decimal places. \n\nSo the code would look like this.\n</think>\n```python\ndef solution():\n    import pandas as pd\n    from dowhy import CausalModel\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Load data\n    data = pd.read_csv(\"ak91.csv\")\n\n    # Create binary variable for being born in Q4\n    data['q4'] = (data['quarter_of_birth'] == 4.0).astype(int)\n    \n    # Convert state_of_birth to categorical\n    data['state_of_birth'] = data['state_of_birth'].astype('category')\n\n    # Define treatment, outcome, instruments, common_causes\n    treatment = 'years_of_schooling'\n    outcome = 'log_wage'\n    instruments = ['q4']\n    common_causes = ['year_of_birth', 'state_of_birth']\n\n    # Build the model\n    model = CausalModel(\n        data=data,\n        treatment=treatment,\n        outcome=outcome,\n        common_causes=common_causes,\n        instruments=instruments\n    )\n\n    # Identify the effect\n    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()\n\n    # Estimate the effect using IV method\n    estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\n                                     method_name=\"iv.instrumental_variable\",\n                                     method_params={'iv_instrument_name': 'q4'})\n\n    # Convert log points to percentage and round to two decimal places\n    percentage_effect = estimate.value * 100\n    return round(percentage_effect, 2)\n```"}
