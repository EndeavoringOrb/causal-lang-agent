This idea takes advantage of US compulsory attendance law. Usually, they state that a kid must have turned 6 years by January 1 of the year they enter school. For this reason, kids that are born at the beginning of the year will enter school at an older age. Compulsory attendance law also requires students to be in school until they turn 16, at which point they are legally allowed to drop out.

Specifically, during a primary election in the state of Michigan, they randomly assigned registered voters to receive different get-out-the-vote (GOTV) messages and examined whether sending postcards with these messages increased turnout. The researchers exploited the fact that the turnout of individual voters is public information in the United States.
